This has the potential to unlock a new generation of medicine: it will enable research and drug discovery to move on from inappropriate models and work with the cells that actually are affected by the human disease. A scalable platform of consistent cells will also be the basis for a new generation of cell and tissue therapies.

They own, install and maintain rapid electric vehicle charging units all over the country, giving landowners the opportunity to earn a rental income by housing them, and giving EV drivers access to the fastest charging available.        They are driven by their passion for protecting the environment. At their core is a mission to improve air quality and reduce carbon emissions.        Air quality has reached critical levels in cities across the UK and cars, buses and lorries have been proven as contributing significantly to the problem. Increasing the use of electric vehicles, which emit zero emissions, is an important part of the solution.        According to Government statistics, one of the biggest barriers that deters people from buying EVs is range anxiety – the fear of running out of charge. InstaVolt will ensure a rapid charging point is easily accessible to everyone in the country.        They believe that charging an electric vehicle should be quick and easy. It’s why, unlike many other companies, they operate an ‘open charger’ model, so anyone can use their charging points on a pay-as-you-go basis.

At the press of a button, Dhalion allows existing O&M teams to complete wind turbine inspections in minutes rather hours with increased inspection quality.        The path is optimised for optimum coverage, reliability in weather and consistent data acquisition. Throughout the flight, Dhalion minds its surrounding and deals intelligently with obstacles and unexpected situations.         The inspection data are then automatically distilled to useful information about position, size, and severity of defects on the tower and blades. It can identify lightning strikes, cracks, erosion and delamination as well as highlight anything out of the ordinary.

Currently focussed on the prospecting and exploration stages, it ultimately aims to extract, process and utilise the materials embedded within some of the millions of Near Earth and Main Belt Asteroids.    We are first and foremost a business. We aim to extract resources from asteroids to boost the Earth's economy and kick start the Space Based Economy as the vast values of some asteroids can be valued in trillions, with the largest asteroids being worth quintillions, while even small asteroids can be hugely valuable. This money will be spent in building ever growing amounts of space infrastructure so that we can eventually allow all humans who desire it to live and work in Space.        Our team is currently working in partnership with the Space Robotics Lab at Tohoku University, Japan, developing SCAR-E. These low-cost, ruggedised, walking and climbing robots will be capable of undertaking asteroid, planetary and lunar exploration, alongside mining operations.          Designed to withstand exposure to radiation, high accelerations experienced during space launch, and extreme temperatures, SCAR-E will be capable of in-orbit asset maintenance such as spacewalking and extravehicular activity.         These unique features will also enable them to function in hostile environments here on Earth, primarily in the fields of nuclear decommissioning, critical infrastructure inspection, mine clearance, and search & rescue operations.","—",,"Mar 25, 2016","$1,019,000","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_total/asteroid-mining-corporation-ltd","Hardware, Natural Resources, Science and Engineering, Transportation","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/hardware-2e6e","Active","https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/asteroid-mining-corporation-ltd","$1,019,000","May 4, 2022","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_at/asteroid-mining-corporation-ltd","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/funding_total/asteroid-mining-corporation-ltd","Private","Seed","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_type/asteroid-mining-corporation-ltd","11-50","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/people/field/organization.companies/num_employees_enum/asteroid-mining-corporation-ltd","Aerospace, Mining, Mining Technology, Satellite Communication, Space Travel","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/categories/aerospace-8a20","Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/location_identifiers/liverpool-liverpool","Asteroid Mining Corporation is a young aerospace start-up company on a mission to exploit the potential of an off-Earth commercial market.","—",,1681292864066,"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 09:47:44 GMT","OgVKnatnE5ak7ftNTGRV","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organization.companies/4bdee9fed7484cf669474f9ba04419e5?pageId=5_a_f89225e7-c8c1-49f0-baf0-589e899ade3a","5"

Veteran founded and owned we focus on supporting users in remote, exposed on challenging environments, including police, service personnel, first responders and NGOs. We’re active in both the UK and US.         Hybrid human-machine teams will be much more effective in protecting assets, people & planet at scale. For that to happen, we need our technology to be able to operate without depending on human attention or on vulnerable infrastructure. We specialise in advanced artificial intelligence (AI) for cameras and GNSS-denied navigation for manned and unmanned systems.            Real time remote monitoring is difficult to achieve with people alone. The areas are often huge and distant, meaning hard-working maintenance, security or safety staff have poor coverage with long response times. Pipeline security, anti-poaching, asset integrity monitoring and border patrol are a few examples. Whilst we (humankind) have developed an impressive array of technologies, including drones and ground sensors, these remain tools to use at long range. These tools are dependent on: 1) human attention to make best use of them and 2) infrastructure to support them, with communications and positional information in particular.         GPS has become increasingly easy to jam and to spoof. Not only that but the orbital infrastructure itself is at direct risk of vandalism.        Archangel Imaging provides a complimentary solution stack to enable human-machine team work in the real world. These make machines smarter, more resilient in a changing situation and easier to work with in a human workflow.         Xnaut AI co-pilots enable existing uncrewed drones, boats and rovers to make mission level navigation decisions based on live observed context. Designed to work when GPS is being spoofed or jammed, Xnaut GENIE Uniquely combines over 50 navigation methods to ensure reliable, resilient and accurate location data is provided to the system's autopilot.          Argonaut smart cameras have been designed to operate independent of infrastructure. The camera and tower products are fully self-contained, with power, communications, sensors and compute.

Through asset management systems, ERP, MES, BMS data, a large amount of operational data has been recorded to provide the basis of performance analysis. We take a data-driven approach using Historical data, ambient data, meteorological data, and Smart energy monitoring to predict an output of future emissions footprint.        With our inbuilt Single Data Model Platform, CarbonAnalytics connects and collects data from all sources along with other external datasets to calculate emissions on process asset level. Our platform uses AI to autoscope and work out up-to-date global factorials & industry protocols for accurate asset level measurement. We also apply external data sets such as weather, traffic to enrich our prediction models        CarbonAnalytics is the only carbon tracking and intelligence company that measures carbon footprint at an asset level. We build asset level traceability accessing data to deep dive Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3.        The capability of our tool really shines in Scope 3 supply chain sustainability analytics in real-time with high accuracy. Achieving carbon neutrality requires a flexible model that captures scope 3 emissions and that still goes deeper across suppliers’ entire footprint.

It helps you get control of who has access to what, why and when – among massive collections of files, folders and sites.         Access to files and folders sprawls much faster than it is controlled. Constant sharing with little visibility or control of who has access to what, leads to significant security and compliance challenges.        Torsion integrates with your existing collaboration systems, working with business users to monitor and control access as circumstances constantly evolve. Working across Microsoft Teams, SharePoint, Office 365 and File Share systems – to improve data security and simplify compliance.

Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning can deliver high ROI across many applications in industry, but its widespread adoption is hampered by a lack of suitable machine learning infrastructure and the need to centralise data which in turn leads to high costs, privacy risks, overdependency on cloud platforms and network availability.         To solve these barriers to AI for Industrial IoT, T-DAB.AI are harnessing a simple but revolutionary idea. Rather than move data from Edge devices to central cloud platforms to train algorithms, move the algorithms to the data and learn at the Edge. Intelligence is achieved by combining learning on many devices via a novel technology called Federated Learning.          To deliver this, T-DAB.AI has created a decentralised AI platform for industrial IoT: OctaiPipe. OctaiPipe represents a paradigm shift in AI solving high value industrial machine intelligence use cases whilst vastly reducing costs, privacy risks, and network or cloud dependency. Customers can either buy pre-built solutions or develop their own to deploy and scale on OctaiPipe.","$1M to $10M","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/revenue_range/r_00001000","2016","£495,000","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_total/the-data-analysis-bureau","Artificial Intelligence, Data and Analytics, Science and Engineering, Software","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/artificial-intelligence-e551","Active","https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/the-data-analysis-bureau","£495,000","Jul 21, 2022","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_at/the-data-analysis-bureau","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/funding_total/the-data-analysis-bureau","Private","Seed","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_type/the-data-analysis-bureau","—",,"Analytics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/categories/analytics","London, England, United Kingdom","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/location_identifiers/london-england","A technology company on a mission to revolutionize the building and transformation of IoT powered businesses through decentralized AI.","—",,1681292864066,"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 09:47:44 GMT","MN8ZEn2R3fm8ViNZXvON","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organization.companies/4bdee9fed7484cf669474f9ba04419e5?pageId=6_a_ffbf3d75-287c-8bd5-54d0-0206f745f9ad","6"

The World Health Organisation currently ranks it as the second greatest burden on the global economy - by 2030 it will be the highest. Just one quarter of people with depression receive any kind of treatment. In the UK this leaves 3.4 million people without even basic support, trying to manage a condition that saps willpower and self-esteem, and leaves even high functioning people struggling to maintain their daily lives.        Tomo is an app designed to increase the time between depressive lows, and to make low periods more manageable for people who suffer from chronic depression. For those affected, a major struggle is managing the impact on cognition. In particular, impaired memory and sense of time impedes habitual behaviours associated with recovery.

Tenants can use our No Deposit solution to secure a new home with just their debit card, paying a small, one-off check-in fee worth only one week’s rent (+VAT), settling any damage charges when it’s time to move out (a bit like checking out of a hotel).        Landlords can top-up their protection with Boost. A solution that offers up to six weeks of extra protection along with fast cost recovery the day after charges are agreed with tenants. It can be used to add protection to a traditional deposit, or on top of flatfair’s No Deposit.        Everything is handled through flatfair’s easy-to-use online platform, where tenants and landlords can handle end of tenancy charges quickly and fairly. And if they can’t agree, government-backed independent adjudicators are on hand to help out.        flatfair's technology makes life easier for agents too, from registration and change of sharer right through to check-out – they’ll also get a commission for bringing on new tenants and landlords too.","—",,"Nov 2016","$11,000,000","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_total/flatfair","Financial Services, Real Estate","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/financial-services-d7b6","Active","https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/flatfair","$13,234,348","Aug 14, 2019","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_at/flatfair","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/funding_total/flatfair","Private","Series A","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_type/flatfair","51-100","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/people/field/organization.companies/num_employees_enum/flatfair","FinTech, Real Estate, Rental Property","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/categories/fintech-e067","London, England, United Kingdom","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/location_identifiers/london-england","Secure your rental with flatfair’s flexible solutions","—",,1681292864066,"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 09:47:44 GMT","HmPA3dJMhcLrckfwcEpU","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organization.companies/4bdee9fed7484cf669474f9ba04419e5?pageId=8_a_4da63fd1-9d1c-4a91-bd6f-5f392c7168cd","8"

Whether selling an old laptop or unlocking cash by collateralizing valuables for a loan, our technology is crafted to enable consumers to do so with unprecedented ease. Snap a picture of your electronics, valuables, apparel or other belongings, get an instant appraisal through our real time valuation engine, and receive a direct payout to your bank account immediately. We are a deep technology company, envisioning a world where products’ lifecycle is lengthened and the ecological burden of trashing minimised.         What exists currently is falling short of the experience modern consumers expect. They value convenience, comfort and speed, and don’t deem existing selling channels even marginally satisfactory. They are tired of the tedious paper-work, negotiating with uncommitted buyers through outdated messaging systems, managing the logistics, and the time-consuming nature of the process. Through our innovative solutions, we are cutting down from days to seconds the time it takes to receive a valuation; and from weeks to hours, the time necessary to sell!        Verado is changing the rules of the game - It’s simplicity, re-engineered. We believe selling should be as seamless as buying. Therefore, rather than accumulating unused products at home or worse letting them end up in a landfill forever -  we enable individuals to monetize their unwanted things, free up valuable space in their home and reduce their need for borrowing whilst simultaneously minimizing their ecological footprint.","Less than $1M","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/revenue_range/r_00000000","Jun 2016","£110,500","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_total/verado","Apps, Commerce and Shopping, Consumer Goods, Internet Services, Mobile, Sales and Marketing, Software","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/apps-2683","Closed","https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/verado","$463,635","May 31, 2019","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_at/verado","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/funding_total/verado","Private","Pre-Seed","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_type/verado","1-10","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/people/field/organization.companies/num_employees_enum/verado","Consumer Goods, E-Commerce, Internet, Mobile Apps, Online Portals, Sales","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/categories/consumer-goods","London, England, United Kingdom","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/location_identifiers/london-england","Verado empowers people to monetise their belongings, instantly.","—",,1681292864066,"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 09:47:44 GMT","Cs9h33yBs78h5gDoxrBs","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organization.companies/4bdee9fed7484cf669474f9ba04419e5?pageId=9_a_6c475898-e043-4a35-b457-8b971240cd19","9"

Gameway empowers users to enjoy discovering the best games on their phone through simplifying the way mobile gaming content is presented to them. Additionally Gameway is set to provide game developers with new tools to enhance their work and increase engagement with fans across the globe.        Our Challenge:    Mobile gaming is growing at a phenomenal rate with over 1000 games released per week across Google’s Play Store and Apple’s App Store.        There are 3.4 million apps and games currently available on the Play Store store alone. With so much choice, it’s no wonder it takes users between 15-60 minutes to manually find a game they may be interested in.        Even when a user does find a game, 72% are uninstalled after being played just twice. By using an app store, users see less than 1% of the games available to them, the majority of these from the large studios with bigger marketing budgets.        Why Now:    Another 1 billion people are expected to gain access to the internet in the next 3 years through mobile. Growing up truly mobile-first they’ll discover all their entertainment, including games via their phones.        Mobile gaming has reached the point of max-saturation, the app stores are overfilled and advertising is pulling customers in every direction to download games.        The recent growth of Artificial Intelligence algorithms, combined with the mass scaling and low cost architectures provided by Amazon and Google, now allow for extremely personalised experiences, distributed across mobile phones around the world in any language.","Less than $1M","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/revenue_range/r_00000000","Feb 23, 2016","—",,"Apps, Artificial Intelligence, Data and Analytics, Gaming, Hardware, Mobile, Science and Engineering, Software","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/apps-2683","Active","https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/andi-2","£68,000","Sep 21, 2019","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_at/andi-2","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/funding_total/andi-2","Private","Seed","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_type/andi-2","1-10","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/people/field/organization.companies/num_employees_enum/andi-2","Artificial Intelligence, Augmented Reality, Big Data, Casual Games, Gaming, Machine Learning, Mobile Apps, Online Games, Video Games, Virtual Reality","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/categories/artificial-intelligence","London, England, United Kingdom","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/location_identifiers/london-england","Gameway is the mobile gaming experience of the future.","—",,1681292864066,"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 09:47:44 GMT","NvTm1gNp5BqIo7vbGWuK","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organization.companies/4bdee9fed7484cf669474f9ba04419e5?pageId=9_a_6c475898-e043-4a35-b457-8b971240cd19","9"

SpeediFly","Alexander Karadjian, Stoyan Dobrev","https://www.crunchbase.com/person/alexander-karadjian","speedifly.com/","http://speedifly.com/","For Profit","info@speedifly.com","SpeediFly is the world`s first social travel platform for ultra spontaneous travellers, providing end-to-end booking based on user interests, and last minute flight and accommodation availability. Recent surveys indicate that 66% of UK Millennials are spontaneous enough to book a flight departing within 72 hours and 83% of the same group are willing to change their schedule if they find a flight to a cool destination under £50. SpeediFly exploits this emerging trend for impulsive decision-making to turn itself into the ultimate catalyst for spontaneous travel for Millennials.         The current problem  on the market is that booking travel is an impersonal and price-centric lonely process. None of the old-fashioned travel platforms make proper use of data analytics for recommendation purposes. All you see on such platforms is “cheap”, ""low-cost”, “discounted”, “limited-time” deals – it is all about the price and nothing about the experience itself. In addition, travel platforms are not social, making it hard for young people to organize group trips as they are now used to doing with Uber or Airbnb.         SpeediFly is a direct response to this problem. By asking users about their interests and leveraging data from social media, SpeediFly makes people-centric and personalized last-minute travel recommendations to individuals and groups of people. SpeediFly lets users invite their Facebook friends, build in-app travel communities, invite others to specific trips, start group bookings and split fares at the end, just like on Uber. By tracking users' in-app activities, our system is capable of predicting what they are likely to book. This allows SpeediFly to make customized recommendations based on user behavior instead of simply trying to sell the cheapest available flights.","Less than $1M","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/revenue_range/r_00000000","2016","€188,000","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_total/speedifly","Apps, Events, Media and Entertainment, Mobile, Software, Travel and Tourism","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/apps-2683","Active","https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/speedifly","€496,000","Jun 13, 2016","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_at/speedifly","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/funding_total/speedifly","Private","Seed","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_type/speedifly","1-10","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/people/field/organization.companies/num_employees_enum/speedifly","Adventure Travel, Mobile Apps, Ticketing, Travel","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/categories/adventure-travel","London, England, United Kingdom","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/location_identifiers/london-england","SpeediFly is for spontaneous travelers who want to get away last minute, but don’t know where they can go on a budget.","—",,1681292864066,"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 09:47:44 GMT","MiODpGvacJYfPeXz9Bz6","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organization.companies/4bdee9fed7484cf669474f9ba04419e5?pageId=9_a_6c475898-e043-4a35-b457-8b971240cd19","9"

Their ideal client is the one who needs to sell to or provide its service with their IoT/M2M devices in different countries and don’t want to deal with different carrier integrations, SIM cards, SIM configurations and invoices. 1oT provides its clients with one invoice, one connectivity management platform, and one eSIM/SIM solution, helping clients to drive their business globally with one end-to-end connectivity solution.         In 2019, 1oT launched the future technology of SIM cards: eSIM. Technically known as eUICC, eSIM is an unlocked SIM card that enables clients to swap carrier services “over-the-air” securely and at a push of a button. Clients can choose one mobile carrier service today (e.g. telecom I) and decide to swap to another one tomorrow (e.g. telecom II), without changing the physical SIM.        In addition to 1oT’s connectivity services, the company has developed an end-to-end IoT connectivity platform, called 1oT Terminal, for clients to control their SIMs & eSIM via a self-service user interface. The platform comes with many value-added services such as API, reporting, diagnostics, and much more. In the future they will add artificial intelligence and machine learning features to the platform that help their customers to get the best possible carrier deals for their eSIM cards.        1oT is part of, and co-founded by Mobi Solutions group (http://mobisolutions.com) which among other things was a key developer of the original Skype mobile application, as well as launching the carrier billing service Fortumo, (https://fortumo.com, backed by Intel Capital), and Messente (https://messente.com), the critical business SMS platform service global clients.","Less than $1M","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/revenue_range/r_00000000","2016","—",,"Hardware, Internet Services, Software","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/hardware-2e6e","Active","https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/1ot","—","Jun 1, 2016","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_at/1ot",,"Private","Seed","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_type/1ot","11-50","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/people/field/organization.companies/num_employees_enum/1ot","Internet, Internet of Things, PaaS, Software, Telecommunications","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/categories/internet","London, England, United Kingdom","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/location_identifiers/london-england","Global IoT Connectivity with eSIM or Traditional SIM","—",,1681292864066,"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 09:47:44 GMT","Re1ewu4P8izQ7pZswbu7","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organization.companies/4bdee9fed7484cf669474f9ba04419e5?pageId=12_a_d0c9eb8f-22c6-08a2-4304-8573a38a0894","12"

We see VR headsets, AR and MR devices becoming readily available in public places. Imagine cardboard headsets in your local shops and communities as readily available and as easily recyclable as coffee cups.            Challenges of VR, AR and MR        For the masses to adopt VR, AR & MR into their daily lives there needs to be the pull of great and diverse content. Unfortunately, VR/AR/MR experiences are very hard to get right – especially for mobile. There are lots of technical challenges to achieve visually stunning and smooth performance as well as a natural interaction within a limited power budget.            Our Content & Technology        We are developing a strong portfolio of VR, AR & MR content covering a wide range of interactive entertainment.

Furthermore, the platform offers unique accommodations to everyone based on their tastes and needs. Roofora is also a special community, where every person can list, discover and book properties in London, and more generally in Europe. Roofora aims to expand its horizon to new cities and new countries with the help and generosity of current and new users, offering them the unique opportunity to discover new comfortable places for their studies, their business journeys, their holidays or simply a new house in a new city. Roofora is an expanding network that links people to a unique experience of booking and travelling. Moreover, with a growing community of users, Roofora is the easiest and fastest way for students and business people to experience their staying in new places. In addition, it offers owners to have a extra property management package that will simplify their lives.        The idealistic concept is to disrupt the real estate market. Roofora wants to change the way how people normally rent a house. Not by going around for days looking a house or a room where to live but by checking on their PC, laptop, smartphone or tablet. Therefore, people can easily check what house to choose within a couple of minutes and they can also control if the property is available or not within few clicks. In addition, in order to prevent any kind of problem, we personally check the properties so that we can make sure that they look exactly how the pictures are, or alternatively we send a photographer to the house of the future owner who wants to rent out a room or the whole house. In this way we assure our customers of the transparency of our service. Furthermore, by making online contracts Roofora wants to simplify all the property management services, decreasing the time customers will spend by going to real estates and checking houses. Additionally, students would be more willing to use our services since we would work in very close contact with them.","Less than $1M","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/revenue_range/r_00000000","May 12, 2016","£5,000","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_total/roofora","Events, Media and Entertainment, Real Estate","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/events-7a2a","Closed","https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/roofora","£5,000","May 12, 2016","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_at/roofora","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/funding_total/roofora","Private","Seed","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_type/roofora","11-50","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/people/field/organization.companies/num_employees_enum/roofora","Rental Property, Reservations","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/categories/rental-property","London, England, United Kingdom","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/location_identifiers/london-england","Roofora is a new exclusive and trusted marketplace specially designed for students, employers and employees.","—",,1681292864067,"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 09:47:44 GMT","XIuYfbYwcJPMiQNF7JR6","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organization.companies/4bdee9fed7484cf669474f9ba04419e5?pageId=14_a_e5496716-7364-f831-4f9a-18deeb5992e0","14"

Your money can never be lent out by the bank: it’s stored in a ring-fenced account, ensuring it's always available for withdrawal.         How much does GoSherpy cost for a user?    No signup costs, no transaction costs and no minimum balance required. Suggested by our users themselves, to prevent you from breaking your piggybank before reaching your target, the only fee applied is a small 3% only in case you withdraw some funds before having reached your goal amount. This is a very rare case, since you also have the possibility to pause a saving plan. Thus GoSherpy is completely free for the Good Sherpies, who consistently reach their target!    We don't invest your savings, there's no interest on them. So how do we pay our rent? When you reach your goal, the seller gives us a small percentage of his earnings on your purchase and GoSherpy stays alive.","—",,"Oct 18, 2016","—",,"Commerce and Shopping, Financial Services","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/commerce-and-shopping","Active","https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/gosherpy","—","Jan 1, 2018","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_at/gosherpy",,"Private","Seed","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_type/gosherpy","1-10","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/people/field/organization.companies/num_employees_enum/gosherpy","E-Commerce, FinTech","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/categories/e-commerce-275d","London, England, United Kingdom","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/location_identifiers/london-england","GoSherpy enables to Save Money towards Personal Goals.

A difference, for example, that can allow an eye surgery to become a outpatient event. MicroSpray technologies are making this a reality by decreasing the size of the drugs into uniform microspheres, which you can then inject into the eye with the smallest gauge needle rather than a more invasive tool. Currently, biopharmaceutical industries use costly chemical methods to manufacture microspheres, which rely on batch-type processes, have a low throughput and produce non-uniform particles. MicroSpray Technologies is developing a spray-manufacturing system which enables reproducible, tight and uniform control of particle size. Allowing clinicians to administer control over the rate at which drugs are delivered to patients, using novel slow release particle technologies.","—",,"2016","—",,"Biotechnology, Health Care, Manufacturing, Science and Engineering","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/biotechnology-0400","Closed","https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/microspray-technologies","—","Jun 22, 2018","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_at/microspray-technologies",,"Private","Seed","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_type/microspray-technologies","1-10","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/people/field/organization.companies/num_employees_enum/microspray-technologies","Biotechnology, Manufacturing, Medical","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/categories/biotechnology","Edinburgh, Edinburgh, City of, United Kingdom","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/location_identifiers/edinburgh-edinburgh,-city-of","MicroSpray Technologies develops high quality research tools for the electrospray community.","—",,1681292864067,"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 09:47:44 GMT","WNr8Owa6OY555Zq84WsF","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organization.companies/4bdee9fed7484cf669474f9ba04419e5?pageId=16_a_1fd3e0e7-059e-4d2c-b9eb-61b0cad4df5b","16"
