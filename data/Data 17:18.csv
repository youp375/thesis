The CaRi-Heart® Analysis Service for cardiac disease diagnosis and risk prediction is Caristo’s flagship offering. It delivers AI-assisted and human-validated visualization of coronary inflammation which is the previously invisible root cause of coronary artery disease. Each patient’s CaRi-Heart® Report is generated on routine cardiac CT scans and can include multiple clinical results: (1) coronary artery specific Fat Attenuation Index (FAI), a novel and patented biomarker for the measurement of coronary inflammation; (2) patient specific CaRi-Heart Risk Score, which assesses 8-10 year cardiac mortality risk (based on both coronary inflammation status and standard clinical risks factors); and (3) plaque specific characterization and quantification. The CaRi-Heart® System is a cloud-based medical device supporting the CaRi-Heart® Analysis Service. The CaRi-Heart® System is CE Mark certified under the latest EU MDR.  Exceptional validation results showing Cari-Heart’s ability to predict heart attack have been published on leading medical journals including the Lancet, JACC and JAMA.

However, only 26% are actually buying from such purpose-driven brands. The reason for this, fundamentally, is that people don't believe that they can make a difference. At Epic Impact we want to change that. We have a vision of a world where every time we spend money, we have a positive impact on humanity, nature and the environment. This is why we have created a new category of lifestyle tool; Personal Impact Management. With a Personal Impact Management solution like Epic's, consumers can better understand, manage and improve the impact that they have on the world around them. Through our mobile app, consumers can: - Let us know what values are important to them, to personalise their Epic Impact experience - Explore a directory of vetted ethical, sustainable merchants, covering categories such as clothing & accessories, homeware, renewable energy, food, and holidays. - Earn real-time, automated rewards whenever they make a purchase from an Epic Impact Rewards merchant. - Use those rewards to donate to charities or offset carbon emissions. - Track the contribution their day-to-day spending make towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals. For merchants, Epic Impact provides: - a no-code integration rewards platform for e-commerce and epos systems that can connect to over 550 solutions, including Shopify, Squarespace, Magento 2, WooCommerce and WIX, and be launched in minutes. - a loyalty rewards platform designed to build values-based relationship with their customers, from exclusive offers, to gift cards, to interactive digital receipts. There is, understandably, a lot of focus on the major issue of climate change and carbon emissions, which is driving an increase in top-down solutions that aim to help consumers reduce their carbon footprint. However, for the majority of consumers, when it comes to the moment of purchase, it is convenience and affordability that are the primary concern, not the carbon footprint of their purchase. Furthermore, being carbon neutral will become as mandatory for merchants as having a website and a social media presence, so what will cause long-term loyalty with companies that have purpose at their core? The answer lies in the alignment of values between merchant and consumer, such as ocean conservation, wildlife protection, the reduction in people suffering hunger and living in poverty. Where Epic Impact differs is that we are taking a bottom up approach, focusing on empowering consumers to support the causes that they care about when they shop. Then, through a growing network effect, this momentum of buying better will support not just reducing carbon emissions, but also creating a cleaner, fairer world for all of humanity, nature and the environment.",$1M to $10M,2017-12-04,day,140000,GBP,195004,"Commerce and Shopping, Other, Sales and Marketing, Sustainability",Active,2021-03-01,,,,,

We have not only found the sexual mating cycle but also discovered the optimum conditions for sexual reproduction.

The launch of a natural and novel range of starter cultures is an industry first.  These unique new cultures are predicted to re-invigorate the blue cheese category that has seen little innovation or differentiation for decades.  Not only is this a worldwide first to market but it is a first-time production of blue cheese starter cultures for the UK.

We always focus on bringing you only reliable, working voucher codes that you can use on the spot and purchase the products you want in no time. One of the most important thing about our site is that we are hand picking each one of the voucher codes. Why is it important to hand pick voucher codes? Most voucher code search engines find this process too tedious, not to mention very time-consuming. But the reality is that once you start using such a website, you realize that most of them are shared by users. While allowing users to share voucher codes is a good idea to have a massive database, the reality is that many of these voucher codes won’t work. As a website user, the last thing you want is to deal with voucher codes that you are unable to use. VoucherToday doesn’t do something like that. We manually visit each website and then we create a list of all the supported voucher codes. We even tell you when the voucher code will expire. This way you will always know exactly how much time you have until that voucher code is no longer valid. This means VoucherToday only offers working voucher codes, and you can start using those codes on the spot in no time. The reason why this approach matters is because it’s a lot better and more reliable than any other similar system. You have a great way to identify only working discount codes, and you can avoid wasting time with codes that are not good at all.",,2018-02-03,day,,,,"Advertising, Commerce and Shopping, Information Technology, Internet Services, Sales and Marketing, Software",Active,2018-01-05,,,,,
