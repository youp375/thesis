Using small arrays of speakers and advanced head tracking technologies, immersive 3D Sound will no longer require headphones or speakers located all around a room. We will deliver an unrivalled, authentic and natural audio experience for consumers of immersive Gaming, VR and Movie audio. The AudioScenic system allows a user to experience sounds in a way which is far superior to a conventional loudspeaker system. In a traditional loudspeaker set-up, sound radiates out from the speaker before bouncing off the walls and other objects in the room prior to reaching the ear. What you hear is a mix of the original and reflected sound creating, at best, a distorted ""3D"" effect. In contrast, AudioScenic delivers controlled and independent sound beams direct to the left and right ears. In this way we can create ""virtual headphones"" and deliver spatial audio which simulates sounds positioned in 3D space all around the listener. In addition, our proprietary head tracking technology enables the independent beams of sound to follow the ears of a listener, delivering perfect 3D Sound no matter what position they occupy or whether they move either whilst playing a computer game or watching a movie. Thanks to AudioScenic's technology the ""sweet-spot"" concept belongs to the past. AudioScenic offers solutions for a range of different platforms and a variety of market applications. Our designs use expandable loudspeakers arrays with varying numbers of drivers to create precisely controlled sound beams.

KironAI is the most advanced and specialized AI solution in the healthcare insurance market, and our proprietary algorithms allow the platform to handle millions of complex claims with ease. By combining the techniques of AI and our extensive industry knowledge of medical claims data, Kirontech will change the way health insurance works for good. There is a growing consensus that AI technology has a vital role to play in the future of health insurance, in the elimination of fraud, waste and abuse, the streamlining and reinforcing of risk assessment processes, and in network optimization. But how? Kirontech works with extensive medical claims data, using machine learning AI to improve the bottom line of insurers, third party administrators and reinsurers, and increase quality of care through better monitoring and management of providers. KironAI uses dynamic “graph–based” learning, which means it discovers rules and patterns from within the data, rather than simply scanning for pre-specified ones; it observes, learns and adapts to new relevant patterns too complicated for the human eye to pick up. The system is ultra-fast and resilient, designed to learn even from scarce data. Kirontech is based in Cambridge, an internationally recognized technology hub. With a presence in London, the largest centre for underwriting commercial and specialty risk in the world, Kirontech is perfectly positioned to make use of its top technical and domain expertise to address the serious issues which impede the health insurance business today.

Over the last ten years, many entrepreneurs have introduced a token or coin to expand their customer network or share their stake in the company. These tokens and coins are freely tradable thanks to blockchain technology. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.",,2017-02-01,month,400000,EUR,474956,"Financial Services, Lending and Investments",Active,2021-04-06,,,,,

Problem We live in a world where critical assets e.g. transportation and communication infrastructure, is in constant danger while governments and consumers are expecting rising levels of security, reliability and performance. Despite the fact that more than 80% of asset failures are due to external factors including climate change-induced weather, less than 10% of assets are digitally inspected once a year or more because of recurring associated costs yet incurring even higher costs when disrupted. This is a core barrier to asset managers' and owners' towards digitalization and predictive maintenance Solution Spottitt is the solution to monitor the external environment around critical assets, at scale in  real time. Organizations use Spottitt throughout an asset's lifecycle to maximise their performance. Our platform automatically transforms the widest variety of satellite and other geospatial data into a stream of metrics to monitor 90% of the causes of asset failure with high accuracy. Our clients enjoy attractive pricing without the need to spend on in-situ operators or sensors. Market Opportunities The Geospatial Analytics market is worth $61B in 2021 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 13.1% over the next 10 years. Spottitt’s current market focus is the $11.4B utility market segment, where the main growth drivers are ageing assets and climate change, digitalization for improved asset performance, safety and reliability Revenue Model and Traction A transparent pay-per-km2, subscription is in development. Main sales channels include direct (50%), digital (20%) and events (30%). Last 18 months: converted 19 new important customers, and already closed follow-on contracts with four of them.

However, only 26% are actually buying from such purpose-driven brands. The reason for this, fundamentally, is that people don't believe that they can make a difference. At Epic Impact we want to change that. We have a vision of a world where every time we spend money, we have a positive impact on humanity, nature and the environment. This is why we have created a new category of lifestyle tool; Personal Impact Management. With a Personal Impact Management solution like Epic's, consumers can better understand, manage and improve the impact that they have on the world around them. Through our mobile app, consumers can: - Let us know what values are important to them, to personalise their Epic Impact experience - Explore a directory of vetted ethical, sustainable merchants, covering categories such as clothing & accessories, homeware, renewable energy, food, and holidays. - Earn real-time, automated rewards whenever they make a purchase from an Epic Impact Rewards merchant. - Use those rewards to donate to charities or offset carbon emissions. - Track the contribution their day-to-day spending make towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals. For merchants, Epic Impact provides: - a no-code integration rewards platform for e-commerce and epos systems that can connect to over 550 solutions, including Shopify, Squarespace, Magento 2, WooCommerce and WIX, and be launched in minutes. - a loyalty rewards platform designed to build values-based relationship with their customers, from exclusive offers, to gift cards, to interactive digital receipts. There is, understandably, a lot of focus on the major issue of climate change and carbon emissions, which is driving an increase in top-down solutions that aim to help consumers reduce their carbon footprint. However, for the majority of consumers, when it comes to the moment of purchase, it is convenience and affordability that are the primary concern, not the carbon footprint of their purchase. Furthermore, being carbon neutral will become as mandatory for merchants as having a website and a social media presence, so what will cause long-term loyalty with companies that have purpose at their core? The answer lies in the alignment of values between merchant and consumer, such as ocean conservation, wildlife protection, the reduction in people suffering hunger and living in poverty. Where Epic Impact differs is that we are taking a bottom up approach, focusing on empowering consumers to support the causes that they care about when they shop. Then, through a growing network effect, this momentum of buying better will support not just reducing carbon emissions, but also creating a cleaner, fairer world for all of humanity, nature and the environment.",$1M to $10M,2017-12-04,day,140000,GBP,195004,"Commerce and Shopping, Other, Sales and Marketing, Sustainability",Active,2021-03-01,,,,,

In most cases this existing approach makes it difficult for high-quality specialist insurers to gain any market share, losing out to either well-known brands or the cheapest providers. This often results in customers purchasing less than adequate cover with companies which in most cases also fail to deliver on their service promise. We believe the consumer should be able to make a far better-informed decisions based upon customer service, claims performance, product quality as well as price. The CBR platform takes advantage of a growing trend of people using reviews as part of their decision buying journey. Review sites such as TrustPilot and feefo do not directly represent the actual provider performance in a specific category of insurance or type of interaction, but tend to be more brand based making it difficult for consumers to gain any understanding of how well these companies service their customers. Therefore, compare by review has been created to service a unique gap in the market combining a richer and smarter review platform with easy-to-understand comparison tables, that allows consumers to make a decision, not influenced purely by monetary bids and commissions, but with richer data aiding a far better-informed choice.",,2017-01-01,year,,,,"Commerce and Shopping, Financial Services",Active,2021-12-10,,,,,

NriDealExpert.com,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nridealexpert-com,,USD,,Private,Pre-Seed,1-10,,"London, England, United Kingdom",A financial marketplace for Non-Resident Indians offering a comparison of India-linked products to maintain their connections with India. ,,,Mohan Lath,http://www.nridealexpert.com,For Profit,contactus@nridealexpert.com,https://www.linkedin.com/company/nridealexpert-com/,"Hi! I'm Mohan Lath, a Non-Resident Indian (NRI) living in the UK. Like all my NRI, Person of Indian Origin (PIO) and Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) friends, I use various India linked products to maintain my connections to India, e.g. NRI bank accounts, NRI fixed deposits, NRI home loan, money transfer to India, calling cards/SIM cards, etc.   However, I always struggled to find an easy way to gather and organise information from a myriad of sources on and off-line that would help me make smart decisions. I had to search through many websites or speak to my friends and family to compare rates, fees and features before identifying the best service to use.  I also found that many other NRIs I spoke to were time-poor and just simply chose the service provider based on Brand awareness or word-of-mouth recommendations, this often led to them losing out on the best value for their money because not all the biggest or best-known companies offered the best deals. That’s when I created NriDealExpert.com as a way for the Indian overseas community to get unbiased listings of India-linked products and services that they can compare and choose, all in one place. I wanted to offer a way that the NRI community could get value and give back by rating and reviewing the service providers, that way it would become a marketplace for the people, for the people.  The website helps you compare prices, features and reviews for NRO or NRE savings accounts, NRI home loans, NRO or NRE fixed deposits, Money transfers to India, India calling plans, etc. The site is constantly updated with the latest information and is expected to grow over time with an expanded list of products and additional countries.
