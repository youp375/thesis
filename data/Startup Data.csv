We help our customers simplify the process of establishing a robust, end-to-end security architecture within the IoT and deliver efficiencies at scale through security automation.        IoT brings new security challenges introduced by the scale and pace of adoption, as well as the physical consequences of compromised security. These challenges cannot be effectively addressed by traditional Information Technology (IT) security solutions. The Device Authority IoT security platform is purpose-built to address these challenges through automated device provisioning, credential management, secure updates and policy-driven data encryption.        The IoT promises countless efficiencies, increased competitiveness, improved customer service and even brand new market opportunities. However, deploying strong security is hard and always has been. Deploying strong IoT security is even harder.  According to Gartner, by 2020, around 25% of all identified security breaches will involve IoT. To address this, Device Authority introduces a new paradigm of IoT Security Automation that accelerates and simplifies the deployment of strong IoT security.        Advanced, policy driven security automation is critical for industrial, healthcare, transportation and other large scale security sensitive IoT environments. Our patented dynamic key technology provides the essential device-based trust anchor for IoT devices, enabling policy-driven provisioning, access control and data protection for mission-critical IoT applications and services.

These services are complex and fragmented so we have developed GENIAC to focus on end-to-end customer intents as opposed to individual products. First off, we provide a named GENIAC manager which gives Startup/SME directors the ability to hand over work to be managed on their behalf, providing significant time back to them to grow their business. Next, rather than just providing a single product like a directors agreement, we deliver a “hire a new director” journey, which encompasses background checks, Companies House registration, a directors agreement, payroll, auto-enrollment pension and key man insurance. These integrated services go across our offering - so, for example, although we have online accounting software and an expenses app, we don’t just stop there, we also deliver the book keeping and tax return services.

Did you know that Google’s data shows that 71% of searchers still call as part of a transaction? But how do you know if your online campaign is driving calls that are converting into a sale and their value so you can fully optimise your online campaign to generate leads that convert better and generate a higher return on investment.        The problem with many call tracking services is they don’t tell you the outcome of a call, they rely on your sales team to accurately report on quality and outcome.        Our next generation call tracking analytics platform, powered by artificial intelligence, scans each call generated using artificial intelligence to establish the outcome; was it a sale, an appointment, a quote or a previous customer phoning up to pay their bill and therefore should be taken out of your results? Removing human error, which naturally occurs when asking colleagues to fill in the outcome of a call and allowing the data to be processed in real-time without the need to upload data, means you can optimise your campaign based on average invoice and sales conversion in a way previously not available. You can now generate higher-converting leads and improve your return on investment by simply having better data insight than other call tracking platforms.        Our call tracking platform links your marketing channels and goes beyond keyword data in Google Ads to show you the keyword query someone searched for before they called, allowing you to optimise your campaign based on sales conversion and sales revenue, not just call volume. It’s why we regularly see clients double their sales conversion and get a better return on investment when they use our platform.        Companies large and small use eSales Hub to generate leads through our fully managed lead generation service, or license the eSales Hub Call Tracking Analytics platform to enhance their own lead generation campaign for a better return on investment.","—",NA,"Mark Taylor, Mark Taylor","https://esaleshub.ai","For Profit","info@esales-hub.com","—","2013",1650000,"GBP","Artificial Intelligence, Data and Analytics, Science and Engineering, Software","Active",2021-04-28

The current state of regulations across every country is based upon paper-based documents, which are interpreted by each public and private organization, resulting with high administration costs, whilst cultivating many types of risks because of the variety of interpretations. An Australian in-depth study (Unleashing Productivity), by Deloitte, estimated that it costs AUD 94bn to administer and comply with Australian federal, state, and local government rules. This equates to circa 6% of Australia’s GDP (Gross Domestic Product). The equivalent annual cost of regulation to the UK economy is GDP 170bn, for the USA economy the cost is USD 1,286bn, and for the world economy the cost is USD 5,236bn.          After extensive research and development, we can now digitise rule-based knowledge such as regulations and procedures. Our approach from the outset, has been to develop a universal and unifying language with embedded methods to transcend from the monologue to the dialogue of rule-based knowledge traditionally found in paper-based documents or equivalent. This quest has been about the shift of treating rule-based knowledge as an intangible to a tangible, working and measurable asset. Our journey has transversed across public and private sectors to ensure our approach was universal in the way it could codify increasing complexity, whilst masking this complexity from the human interaction. Just as importantly, we have automatically generated an audit trail of the human interaction for safeguarding people and organisations. The biggest value comes from the standardisation of dialogue-data, which enables continuous intelligence, benchmarks, patterns and predictions to be delivered in an accurate and timely manner for learnings at the edge.         Our technology covers: RegTech, White-box Algorithms, Dialogue-Step Orchestration (contextual data input, image, picture, pickup codes, adaptive cars); Digital Agents (stateless software services similar in concept to Agent-Based Models), Azure Cloud, SaaS, new form of Big Data (one dimensional dialogue-strings), Compliance Automation, Analytics, APIs, Progressive Web Apps,  access from multiple channels, and AI/ML.","—",NA,"Freddie McMahon, John Rawlings","http://df2020.com","For Profit","info@df2020.com","Less than $1M","2014",250000,"GBP","Artificial Intelligence, Data and Analytics, Information Technology, Science and Engineering, Software","Active",2016-04-30

In addition, it is obvious that, in a situation where a neighbourhood is threatened by a sudden flood emergency, there will only ever be one way in which the majority of properties may be protected and that is if each householder is able to protect his own property. No government body could hope to deploy enough resources fast enough to compete.        The FloodKit concept is to empower the householder to protect his own home by equipping him with the tools to do that at an affordable price. The kit is designed to provide a complete and comprehensive set of flood protection products for use by a householder in an emergency. The products have all been rigorously tested, are easy to use and proven to work at least as well as many far more expensive items currently on the market.

It will allow food delivery businesses to borrow and lend drivers from one another at short notice. In addition, GPS tracking will provide full visibility of all orders.         One member generates revenue from otherwise redundant resource while the other is able to keep their customer satisfied.        Food delivery businesses can't always predict when there will be a surge in the number of orders received and as such struggle to meet customer expectations with timely deliveries.        One of the key contributors to this is the limited access to delivery drivers. Further, the majority don't have access to an affordable solution to track their drivers which then makes the dispatch process inefficient.        The Delivery Club technology platform is being designed to tackle both of these challenges, providing a holistic solution.        With the comfort that they can access drivers when needed, we believe these businesses would be more inclined to increase their marketing spend and grow their businesses. Further, they would have the ability to earn money towards the cost of their delivery drivers when they would otherwise be idle. The GPS tracking would allow them to run a more efficient dispatch process and increase customer satisfaction levels.        Overall, food delivery businesses should run more efficiently, ultimately improving their profitability.

Some of them have worked in different scenarios, but they lack of proper online tools that could increase the level of influence of the initiatives.        FanVox, therefore, emerges as the natural response to this new phenomenon by providing a digital platform that centralises the football fans interests and initiatives and turn them into actions to collectively leverage a degree of influence within the football industry.","—",NA,"Daniel Velásquez, Jimmy Tadić","http://www.fanvox.net","For Profit","info@fanvox.net","Less than $1M","2014",20000,"GBP","Financial Services, Lending and Investments, Sports","Closed",2015-09-23

And Zettabox has been designed with data protection built in to guarantee compliance with the new, upcoming EU regulation.         When the team began building Zettabox, the total amount of worldwide data saved on networks had surpassed the 1,000 Exabytes and entered a new era of sizing storage – Zettabytes (1 X 1021). Zettabox was created to help companies and individual keep control of that surging amount of content.        The cloud team sharing and storage market is currently dominated by American-domiciled companies, which means the majority of users’ data is stored in the US or is stored in European data centres that are accessible by the US government (because those data centres are owned by US-domiciled companies). There is impending EU regulation requiring companies doing business in Europe to know where their data is stored and to be able to communicate that to their customers. Zettabox was launched as a European alternative to the US companies that are providing team sharing and cloud-based storage services.

There has been a recent massive expansion in educational resources being made available online in a wide variety of formats. This is disrupting the traditional ways in which people are educated both academically and professionally. A major part of this change is the unbundling of the educational experience such that people are using a much greater mixture of providers and methods of learning rather than the single channel of a traditional institution. With so much content, so many platforms and different approaches coming online in a short space of time people need a way to find the appropriate resources for their own situation and learning style – traditional search, such as google is not helpful for this. Our aim is to provide a context for these resources of variegated and unknown quality so that people use the resources that are most helpful in complementing their formal studies or professional development.        edspire is incubated by the Isis software incubator, part of Isis Innovation, the technology transfer company of the University of Oxford.","—",NA,"—","http://edspire.com","For Profit","website@edspire.com","$1M to $10M","2014",NA,"—","Education, Internet Services, Software","Closed",2013-03-01

EDTA is a chemical which can inhibit the development of such biofilms.        Biofilms are a major problem for human infections and medical device related infections due to their becoming resistant to antibiotics, with the result being wounds that are slow to heal, or not healing/remaining open.

We provide unprecedented levels of support and training, to help our members make the most of their time on the road.        And, by providing members with data and analytics, we give them the opportunity to become more profitable and safer drivers. All that, plus the chance to connect with other drivers and be part of a growing community, making driving a more sustainable way of earning an income.        Splend has enabled students, retirees, former refugees and single parents to find work they enjoy, and that fits their lifestyle. Equally, we’ve provided exciting opportunities for first-time buyers to own a brand new car. We couldn’t be prouder of what we’ve achieved so far, and we’re only just getting started.

We build member-owned and governed decentralised network platforms for the peer-to-peer exchange of tokenised value between network members. Our ethos and architecture is grounded in protocol, peer-to-peer architecture, removing friction and market inefficiencies, strong security guarantees and interoperable exchange across platforms to build a peer-to-peer ecosystem for market infrastructure. Our focus is capital markets; we work with firms that have the ambition to reinvent the industry's business models.        Our technology is p2p network platforms and protocol first - protocol suite, software that implements those protocols and provides client software and infrastructure for p2p networks. Its based on Ethereum and we call it Autonity - the protocol, the Geth-based client.        We use our technology to build p2p networks and dFMI.        P2p networks are private, member-owned and governed networks that enable peer-to-peer transfer of financial value and automation of contractual and fiduciary operations without reliance on trusted third-parties. Such decentralised networks can interact with one another, creating a wider ecosystem of value and leveraging the network effect, and they can form part of a dFMI.        dFMI is a new concept, one that builds on the security and resilience guarantees of distributed ledger and systems engineering to provide a platform for tokenising value and transferring its ownership between participants on that or, by cross-platform exchange, on other platforms.        We believe that our technology will drive adoption of a next-generation dFMI where intermediaries are removed, incentive structures encourage self-regulation, and risks are mitigated and reduced to the maximum. dFMI doesn't just provide a cryptographically secure environment for market participants to transact, it provides a peer-to-peer model that removes financial intermediaries and engenders a wider ecosystem for value transfer across platforms and pre- post-trade processes. dFMI works to mitigate concentration and liquidity risk, reduce settlement cycles to real-time, remove friction, and lower the transaction cost of economic exchange.

The Alphamer technology is based on ""programmable immunity"" in which chemically synthesised molecules redirect naturally occurring antibodies to selected pathogens to fight the infection. The molecules have two distinct parts: one end binds a cell-surface target on the pathogen using an aptamer whereas the other end presents specific epitopes that attach to the circulating antibodies. It has been demonstrated that Alphamers have the potential to redirect pre-existing antibodies to bacteria in a specific manner and trigger an immediate antibacterial immune response, so clearing the infection.         Centauri Therapeutics’ strategy is to redirect naturally occurring antibodies to target disease. Centauri Therapeutics' unique Chemistry Platform provides a flexible scaffold to enable the synthesis of specific Alphamers. These are bifunctional molecules which present a selective cell binding moiety as well as an epitope that recruits pre-existing antibodies, resulting in cell killing.         Centauri Therapeutics believes their technology is widely applicable in the treatment of life threatening infectious diseases. Companies with an interest in accessing Centauri’s Alphamer technology or with an interest in one of their current projects, are warmly encouraged to contact them to discuss partnering opportunities.         In order to drive success in the important area of immuno-oncology, Centauri Therapeutics has established a joint venture, Avvinity Therapeutics, with Horizon Discovery in March 2016. Avvinity combines Centauri’s Alphamer Technology with the gene editing and oncology expertise of Horizon.         In addition to Centauri Therapeutics' immuno-oncology joint venture, Centauri maintains a strong network of collaborators in the areas of aptamer selection, drug discovery, chemistry and immunology.","—",NA,"Stuart Lawson","http://www.centauritherapeutics.com","For Profit","info@centauritherapeutics.com","—","2015",2.4e+07,"GBP","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering","Active",2022-02-16

The model is annotated with explanatory information so they can easily explore and learn about different parts of their body.

These show how well different muscle groups are developed and the distribution of subcutaneous and visceral fat deposits.        MRI is a safe technology, and with regular scanning Klarismo updates a user’s 3D body model to highlight exactly where and how much muscle or fat has been gained or lost.

Sensitive data loss and leaks are problems faced by more than 78% of SMBs according to a 2014 survey. Among them, 72% shut down less than 1 year after the incident. Just one of these incidents led to $6.2M losses. The solutions currently are either insufficient of too expensive for these companies.        Ukkobox (Company no. 09527513 - UK). has an easy tool that safely encrypts and spreads user files to existing cloud providers worldwide. Because they store only parts of the files on each provider with redundancy, they are secured and accessible even if some of these providers suffer an outage or are hacked.         Their unique dispersal process developed by Univ. of São Paulo (Brazil) and Univ. of Leicester (UK) represents an entry technological barrier that can be patented. If the user requires additional privacy levels, they can choose providers from states with weak international relations among themselves and distinct data privacy laws/regulations. This provides an additional geopolitical security mechanism resilient to encryption vulnerabilities, which makes unauthorized access even from governments almost impossible. They will have to cooperate with ""enemies"" countries to retrieve all data slices and also break data encryption to access user files.This technology able to scale globally along with a multi-skilled team, composed with founders with high technical security and cloud background, business knowledge, international law and creative marketing and design are the most interesting Ukkobox assets.         For the user it is straightforward. He just download and install their  app, choose the providers and countries he wishes to use for his spreading storage box, receives a temporary authentication token in his mobile and put the files inside Ukkobox folder. Their app will then encrypt, split and spread the files from the user device to storage providers directly. This ensures that they will have zero knowledge of the user stored data and access patterns. Thus ensuring full privacy for their customer's stored data.        They will monetize their  solution using a SaaS model. The consumer chooses the providers (and countries) used to create his private data storage network, the storage size he need and the amount of users. From these informations, the monthly/yearly price is calculated. This model offers the reliability to use several storage providers at the same time avoiding vendor lock-in, increasing availability, privacy and security but with the convenience to manage only one account.","—",NA,"Edgard Regolão Jr, Paul Chu, Rafael Libardi","http://www.ukkobox.com","For Profit","contact@ukkobox.com","Less than $1M","2015",15000,"GBP","Information Technology, Internet Services, Privacy and Security, Software","Active",2016-03-07

It is designed for tracking mobile apps (iOS/Android) statistics.        BASIC IDEA    Let’s assume that you are an app owner, for example a game developer. You might want to know in detail what your users do within your game: how many users manage to get through the first or second level; how many gamers use in-app payments and when they use it (particular game level/ time of the day/week).        Moreover, app owner may require installation data: total installations number, the source of installation, whether it was commercial traffic or organic one (AppStore or Google play). Also, you would probably like to know the most effective traffic source (advertising networks, CPI/CPA services) in terms of the maximum download number, the most loyal customers attracted and the highest income, based on the comparison of the traffic source, installation, and in-app purchases.        Surely you acquire your traffic via CPI/CPA model and would like to have a sustainable integration in media sources that will send postbacks to CPI/CPA right after the first app’s initialization.        InstallTracker can do all of the above and even more.

The unique CricViz computer model enables the prediction of match outcome, the interpretation of team and player performance and the anticipation of what is likely to happen next; cricket intelligence at the next level.        WinViz probabilities are generated by CricViz’s unique computer model of Test cricket. This utilises a database of the last 500 Test matches played, using past and current data to estimate the probability of future events.        The model uses the current state of the match, each player’s career history and characteristics of the venue and host country to simulate the remainder of the match. The simulations are run thousands of times, with the number of results that produce each match outcome converted into probabilities – if 4,000 out of 10,000 iterations result in a team winning, then that team has a 40% probability of winning.        The PredictViz function outlines the most likely course the match will follow from its current position. The unique CricViz model of past and current data simulates the remainder of the game thousands of times, with the average predicted outcome for each team plotted across the game’s remaining timeline.        The likeliest score and end point of each innings is predicted using the current state of the match, each player’s career history and characteristics of the venue and host country.        PlayViz breaks down each team’s performance into its three basic aspects – batting, bowling and fielding. Each of those areas is given a positive or negative score in runs, measuring the performance of that team against that of an average Test team in the conditions present at that time.        Team performances are compared to those of an average Test team, with adjustments taken into account for the pitch and opposition strength. The comprehensive historical database predicts the average performance of batsmen and bowlers in the position and role they are playing in. The PlayViz function measures performance relative to averages that take into account extra variables.        Each team’s fielding performance is measured on the direct impact it has had on the score. Runs saved and missed are totalled for each player, with a dropped catch measured at the value of the wicket that was missed according to the model of projected scores. Fielding scores are adjusted by a system that rates the difficulty of a piece of fielding.        BatViz gives a measure of how difficult batting has been in the last 30 minutes of play. It shows how hard it is for the batsmen to survive and score.        The ball tracking data from every ball bowled in the match is compared to a database of over 300,000 Test deliveries. The balls in this database that are the most similar to the delivery being measured are evaluated in terms of wickets taken and runs conceded, with a game aggregate built to provide a metric of current batting difficulty at that time.","—",NA,"Nathan Leamon, Phil Oliver","http://cricviz.com","For Profit","marketing@cricviz.com","$1M to $10M","2015",NA,"—","Artificial Intelligence, Data and Analytics, Software, Sports","Active",2015-10-20

Majority of these shoppers leave due to price considerations; so you can imagine the amount of money being left on the table! We help any online retailer that wants to increase customer retention & turn their inventory faster without giving one-size-fits all discounts.        We do this by allowing online, automated price negotiation. FOSHO is a machine learning based API that retailers can embed on their site / chatbot and allow shoppers to negotiate. We all know what negotiation means, we have  certainly negotiated when we wanted a better salary or a cheaper car but, we have never experienced the ability to negotiate when we have shopped online!        That’s the innovation of FOSHO. Users can negotiate on any product / service by making offers and our smart interface responds with instant, personalised counteroffers! A shopper can negotiate by making multiple offers within 2 minutes till FOSHO agrees on the price. Now shoppers don’t need to waste time on promo codes, cash back options or even waiting for sales seasons. And the online retailer is better off with more sales and happier customers. FOSHO is unique as it even gives you discounts to you in lieu of newsletter subscription, product reviews, waiving return rights, helping maintain retailer’s ROI and other customisable options – which has never been done before!              Fosho does this though its unique negotiation algorithm, which takes pre-defined rules from vendors and then optimises for various parameters real time. The shopper can thus 'negotiate' for price at point-of-sale.         This technology allows vendors to increase their profits without giving the same, flat discount to all.  Its a more efficient way of economic optimisation!","—",NA,"Khyati Sundaram, Pratyush Lal","https://fosho.co.in/demo/product-details.php?prod_id=3","For Profit","contact@ffosho.com","—","2015",16000,"USD","Artificial Intelligence, Commerce and Shopping, Data and Analytics, Software","Closed",2015-11-01

These measurements are used to parametrically adjust the pattern of the bra she selects - using a series of algorithms to create a pattern that is 100% the perfect fit for the woman.     The bras are then custom made currently manually but shortly with robotic technology, currently they are first to market with this technology.     More than 85% of women are currently wearing the incorrect sized bra leading to scientifically and medically proven medical and postural problems - some serious.     The major cause of this is incorrect measurements as Traditional Bras are based on only three measurements. A second cause is inconsistent sizing due to style differences. A third issue is attempting to fit a non-standard bust in a standard (within brands) sizing system.        In terms of competitors at this stage there is no one in the marketplace doing what they do in terms of the mobile scanning and parametric adjustment of patterns - soon, every smart phone will have this technology in them... So now is the time to build the business taking advantage of this hardware becoming ubiquitous, in perpetration for the market shift.    The closest competitor they would have is True&Co a highly successful start-up online lingerie company based in San Francisco - but they base their sizing on the traditional 3 sizes and suggest the correct size to potential consumers via an online quiz.","—",NA,"Judy van Niekerk, Tiny van Niekerk","http://www.thedigitalbra.com/","For Profit","judy@thedigitalbra.com","—","2015",NA,"—","Apps, Clothing and Apparel, Consumer Goods, Design, Hardware, Mobile, Science and Engineering, Software","Active",2015-01-01

Increasing the use of electric vehicles, which emit zero emissions, is an important part of the solution.

Veteran founded and owned we focus on supporting users in remote, exposed on challenging environments, including police, service personnel, first responders and NGOs. We’re active in both the UK and US.         Hybrid human-machine teams will be much more effective in protecting assets, people & planet at scale. For that to happen, we need our technology to be able to operate without depending on human attention or on vulnerable infrastructure. We specialise in advanced artificial intelligence (AI) for cameras and GNSS-denied navigation for manned and unmanned systems.            Real time remote monitoring is difficult to achieve with people alone. The areas are often huge and distant, meaning hard-working maintenance, security or safety staff have poor coverage with long response times. Pipeline security, anti-poaching, asset integrity monitoring and border patrol are a few examples. Whilst we (humankind) have developed an impressive array of technologies, including drones and ground sensors, these remain tools to use at long range. These tools are dependent on: 1) human attention to make best use of them and 2) infrastructure to support them, with communications and positional information in particular.         GPS has become increasingly easy to jam and to spoof. Not only that but the orbital infrastructure itself is at direct risk of vandalism.        Archangel Imaging provides a complimentary solution stack to enable human-machine team work in the real world. These make machines smarter, more resilient in a changing situation and easier to work with in a human workflow.         Xnaut AI co-pilots enable existing uncrewed drones, boats and rovers to make mission level navigation decisions based on live observed context. Designed to work when GPS is being spoofed or jammed, Xnaut GENIE Uniquely combines over 50 navigation methods to ensure reliable, resilient and accurate location data is provided to the system's autopilot.

The World Health Organisation currently ranks it as the second greatest burden on the global economy - by 2030 it will be the highest. Just one quarter of people with depression receive any kind of treatment. In the UK this leaves 3.4 million people without even basic support, trying to manage a condition that saps willpower and self-esteem, and leaves even high functioning people struggling to maintain their daily lives.        Tomo is an app designed to increase the time between depressive lows, and to make low periods more manageable for people who suffer from chronic depression. For those affected, a major struggle is managing the impact on cognition. In particular, impaired memory and sense of time impedes habitual behaviours associated with recovery.

Gameway empowers users to enjoy discovering the best games on their phone through simplifying the way mobile gaming content is presented to them. Additionally Gameway is set to provide game developers with new tools to enhance their work and increase engagement with fans across the globe.        Our Challenge:    Mobile gaming is growing at a phenomenal rate with over 1000 games released per week across Google’s Play Store and Apple’s App Store.        There are 3.4 million apps and games currently available on the Play Store store alone. With so much choice, it’s no wonder it takes users between 15-60 minutes to manually find a game they may be interested in.        Even when a user does find a game, 72% are uninstalled after being played just twice. By using an app store, users see less than 1% of the games available to them, the majority of these from the large studios with bigger marketing budgets.        Why Now:    Another 1 billion people are expected to gain access to the internet in the next 3 years through mobile. Growing up truly mobile-first they’ll discover all their entertainment, including games via their phones.        Mobile gaming has reached the point of max-saturation, the app stores are overfilled and advertising is pulling customers in every direction to download games.        The recent growth of Artificial Intelligence algorithms, combined with the mass scaling and low cost architectures provided by Amazon and Google, now allow for extremely personalised experiences, distributed across mobile phones around the world in any language.","—",NA,"Benjamin Woolf, Samuel Koch","https://dan.com","For Profit","contact@gameway.io","Less than $1M","2016",NA,"—","Apps, Artificial Intelligence, Data and Analytics, Gaming, Hardware, Mobile, Science and Engineering, Software","Active",2019-09-21

Recent surveys indicate that 66% of UK Millennials are spontaneous enough to book a flight departing within 72 hours and 83% of the same group are willing to change their schedule if they find a flight to a cool destination under £50. SpeediFly exploits this emerging trend for impulsive decision-making to turn itself into the ultimate catalyst for spontaneous travel for Millennials.         The current problem  on the market is that booking travel is an impersonal and price-centric lonely process. None of the old-fashioned travel platforms make proper use of data analytics for recommendation purposes. All you see on such platforms is “cheap”, ""low-cost”, “discounted”, “limited-time” deals – it is all about the price and nothing about the experience itself. In addition, travel platforms are not social, making it hard for young people to organize group trips as they are now used to doing with Uber or Airbnb.         SpeediFly is a direct response to this problem. By asking users about their interests and leveraging data from social media, SpeediFly makes people-centric and personalized last-minute travel recommendations to individuals and groups of people. SpeediFly lets users invite their Facebook friends, build in-app travel communities, invite others to specific trips, start group bookings and split fares at the end, just like on Uber. By tracking users' in-app activities, our system is capable of predicting what they are likely to book. This allows SpeediFly to make customized recommendations based on user behavior instead of simply trying to sell the cheapest available flights.","—",NA,"Alexander Karadjian, Stoyan Dobrev","http://speedifly.com/","For Profit","info@speedifly.com","Less than $1M","2016",188000,"EUR","Apps, Events, Media and Entertainment, Mobile, Software, Travel and Tourism","Active",2016-06-13

In addition to 1oT’s connectivity services, the company has developed an end-to-end IoT connectivity platform, called 1oT Terminal, for clients to control their SIMs & eSIM via a self-service user interface. The platform comes with many value-added services such as API, reporting, diagnostics, and much more. In the future they will add artificial intelligence and machine learning features to the platform that help their customers to get the best possible carrier deals for their eSIM cards.        1oT is part of, and co-founded by Mobi Solutions group (http://mobisolutions.com) which among other things was a key developer of the original Skype mobile application, as well as launching the carrier billing service Fortumo, (https://fortumo.com, backed by Intel Capital), and Messente (https://messente.com), the critical business SMS platform service global clients.","—",NA,"Marko Peterson, Märt Kroodo, Rain Rannu","http://1oT.com","For Profit","hello@1oT.com","Less than $1M","2016",NA,"—","Hardware, Internet Services, Software","Active",2016-06-01

Therefore, people can easily check what house to choose within a couple of minutes and they can also control if the property is available or not within few clicks. In addition, in order to prevent any kind of problem, we personally check the properties so that we can make sure that they look exactly how the pictures are, or alternatively we send a photographer to the house of the future owner who wants to rent out a room or the whole house. In this way we assure our customers of the transparency of our service. Furthermore, by making online contracts Roofora wants to simplify all the property management services, decreasing the time customers will spend by going to real estates and checking houses.
