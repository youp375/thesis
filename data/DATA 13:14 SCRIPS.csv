They make hiring local, trusted service professionals ridiculously simple - and help people use the time saved to pursue their passions.        Getting things done is awesome. More accurately, being done and enjoying the outcome is the real reward of dealing with the smallest fix to the largest project. The problem is that finding someone to help you get there has remained a hassle. Wasn’t technology supposed to help with things like that?         While looking to achieve personal goals, find a language tutor for their kids, renovate their house and even clear a wasp nest from their front door, they were spending more time on legwork than on the things they love. They would rather take their kids to the park than hunt for an electrician that can come next Tuesday. They would rather take their journal to the café than search for a quality Arabic language tutor. This is why they started Bidvine. They wanted a better way to find local service providers who could do what they needed, were available when they needed them, and were interested to help. With a background in marketing and marketplaces, as a team they felt uniquely positioned to tackle this challenge and build a business that could be everyone’s first and best choice for getting from to-do to done as quickly as possible.         They first conceived of this idea in a shared workspace in Dubai, UAE, are building the platform in Waterloo, Canada, are creating the reality of Bidvine and going to market in London, UK - and through it all they are powered by people.","$1M to $10M","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/revenue_range/r_00001000","2014","£1,400,000","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_total/bidvine","Information Technology","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/information-technology-4fe3","Active","https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bidvine","$6,346,473","Oct 1, 2017","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_at/bidvine","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/funding_total/bidvine","Private","Venture - Series Unknown","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_type/bidvine","11-50","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/people/field/organization.companies/num_employees_enum/bidvine","Information Services","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/categories/information-services-f579","London, England, United Kingdom","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/location_identifiers/london-england","Bidvine is a marketplace connecting consumers and businesses with professionals.","—",,1681292005470,"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 09:33:25 GMT","DeuqzQlNOff9ji9JIRM6","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organization.companies/b5026de0afcda8b38e9fbb759187ca45?pageId=2_a_66d0dec0-57db-4e84-077e-d72a9436b4c6","2"

System integrations, centralisation and point to point solutions are costly, duplicate date, and increase risk of failure.        The solution is a secure ecosystem of data interactions, filtering what matters at source and channelling it to where it's needed. Data is not duplicated.

Conventional switch architectures no longer meet this need as they cannot accommodate next generation 400 G bps data rates.","—",,"2014","—",,"Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Manufacturing, Science and Engineering","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/consumer-electronics-52f3","Active","https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/roadmap","$2,325,000","May 25, 2018","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_at/roadmap","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/funding_total/roadmap","Private","Series B","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_type/roadmap","1-10","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/people/field/organization.companies/num_employees_enum/roadmap","Advanced Materials, Chemical, Electronics","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/categories/advanced-materials","Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/location_identifiers/cambridge-cambridgeshire","RoadMap is founded on four patents licensed from the Cambridge Centre for Advanced Photonics and Electronics (CAPE) in the area.","—",,1681292005471,"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 09:33:25 GMT","51CjjnjBTzvyY2OTCqUJ","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organization.companies/b5026de0afcda8b38e9fbb759187ca45?pageId=6_a_581174f1-6731-6e25-553f-7f45939bf4c0","6"

We help our customers simplify the process of establishing a robust, end-to-end security architecture within the IoT and deliver efficiencies at scale through security automation.        IoT brings new security challenges introduced by the scale and pace of adoption, as well as the physical consequences of compromised security. These challenges cannot be effectively addressed by traditional Information Technology (IT) security solutions. The Device Authority IoT security platform is purpose-built to address these challenges through automated device provisioning, credential management, secure updates and policy-driven data encryption.        The IoT promises countless efficiencies, increased competitiveness, improved customer service and even brand new market opportunities. However, deploying strong security is hard and always has been. Deploying strong IoT security is even harder.  According to Gartner, by 2020, around 25% of all identified security breaches will involve IoT. To address this, Device Authority introduces a new paradigm of IoT Security Automation that accelerates and simplifies the deployment of strong IoT security.        Advanced, policy driven security automation is critical for industrial, healthcare, transportation and other large scale security sensitive IoT environments. Our patented dynamic key technology provides the essential device-based trust anchor for IoT devices, enabling policy-driven provisioning, access control and data protection for mission-critical IoT applications and services.            The dedicated IoT Security entity was launched in September 2014 when the Cryptosoft technology was spun out with backing from the current investors. In April 2016 Cryptosoft acquired DeviceAuthority Inc, and subsequently the changed its name to Device Authority Ltd, headquartered in the UK and with a technical development center based in San Ramon, CA.","$1M to $10M","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/revenue_range/r_00001000","Sep 2014","$2,900,000","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_total/cryptosoft-ltd","Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Information Technology, Internet Services, Privacy and Security, Software","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/consumer-electronics-52f3","Active","https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cryptosoft-ltd","$2,900,000","Dec 2, 2021","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_at/cryptosoft-ltd","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/funding_total/cryptosoft-ltd","Private","Venture - Series Unknown","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_type/cryptosoft-ltd","11-50","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/people/field/organization.companies/num_employees_enum/cryptosoft-ltd","Computer, Cyber Security, Information Services, Information Technology, Internet of Things, Network Security, Security, Software","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/categories/computer","Reading, Reading, United Kingdom","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/location_identifiers/reading-reading","Device Authority is a global leader in Identity and Access Management (IAM) for the Internet of Things (IoT) and Blockchain.","Device Authority acquired by Cryptosoft","https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/cryptosoft-acquires-cryptosoft-ltd--466bc5bb",1681292005471,"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 09:33:25 GMT","wwc2k4ucGQpBsx2r27SB","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organization.companies/b5026de0afcda8b38e9fbb759187ca45?pageId=6_a_581174f1-6731-6e25-553f-7f45939bf4c0","6"

We have created a single services platform to deliver integrated HR, Legal, Accounting and Insurance services for Startups and SMEs. These services are complex and fragmented so we have developed GENIAC to focus on end-to-end customer intents as opposed to individual products. First off, we provide a named GENIAC manager which gives Startup/SME directors the ability to hand over work to be managed on their behalf, providing significant time back to them to grow their business. Next, rather than just providing a single product like a directors agreement, we deliver a “hire a new director” journey, which encompasses background checks, Companies House registration, a directors agreement, payroll, auto-enrollment pension and key man insurance. These integrated services go across our offering - so, for example, although we have online accounting software and an expenses app, we don’t just stop there, we also deliver the book keeping and tax return services. We achieve this through an intuitive intent driven portal, integrated data services that don’t require our intervention, and managed services delivered through our shared service centre.","$1M to $10M","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/revenue_range/r_00001000","2014","£22,000,000","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_total/geniac","Administrative Services, Financial Services, Other, Professional Services","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/administrative-services","Closed","https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/geniac","£23,000,000","Jul 2, 2015","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_at/geniac","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/funding_total/geniac","Private","Series A","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_type/geniac","11-50","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/people/field/organization.companies/num_employees_enum/geniac","Accounting, Human Resources, Legal, Small and Medium Businesses","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/categories/accounting","London, England, United Kingdom","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/location_identifiers/london-england","GENIAC provides essential business services for SMEs, all in one place, and all managed on their behalf.","—",,1681292005471,"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 09:33:25 GMT","J1YRaLRx5Np49SvylRGY","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organization.companies/b5026de0afcda8b38e9fbb759187ca45?pageId=7_a_9746146f-6728-c1b5-7579-33ee16d883b5","7"

Did you know that Google’s data shows that 71% of searchers still call as part of a transaction? But how do you know if your online campaign is driving calls that are converting into a sale and their value so you can fully optimise your online campaign to generate leads that convert better and generate a higher return on investment.        The problem with many call tracking services is they don’t tell you the outcome of a call, they rely on your sales team to accurately report on quality and outcome.        Our next generation call tracking analytics platform, powered by artificial intelligence, scans each call generated using artificial intelligence to establish the outcome; was it a sale, an appointment, a quote or a previous customer phoning up to pay their bill and therefore should be taken out of your results? Removing human error, which naturally occurs when asking colleagues to fill in the outcome of a call and allowing the data to be processed in real-time without the need to upload data, means you can optimise your campaign based on average invoice and sales conversion in a way previously not available. You can now generate higher-converting leads and improve your return on investment by simply having better data insight than other call tracking platforms.        Our call tracking platform links your marketing channels and goes beyond keyword data in Google Ads to show you the keyword query someone searched for before they called, allowing you to optimise your campaign based on sales conversion and sales revenue, not just call volume. It’s why we regularly see clients double their sales conversion and get a better return on investment when they use our platform.        Companies large and small use eSales Hub to generate leads through our fully managed lead generation service, or license the eSales Hub Call Tracking Analytics platform to enhance their own lead generation campaign for a better return on investment.","—",,"Dec 31, 2013","£1,650,000","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_total/esales-hub","Artificial Intelligence, Data and Analytics, Science and Engineering, Software","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/artificial-intelligence-e551","Active","https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/esales-hub","£1,650,000","Apr 28, 2021","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_at/esales-hub","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/funding_total/esales-hub","Private","Series A","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_type/esales-hub","11-50","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/people/field/organization.companies/num_employees_enum/esales-hub","Artificial Intelligence, Software","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/categories/artificial-intelligence","Doncaster, Doncaster, United Kingdom","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/location_identifiers/doncaster-doncaster","Data-Driven A.I.

With our innovative data capturing capabilities, powerful statistics and in depth practice planning, coaches can now take their coaching one step further.        I had the idea for Coacher when I stopped playing football and started coaching. An amateur football coach records a massive array of information each season, such as training data, match data, and regular admin data. This is generally done using pen, paper, and Excel, which is inefficient and difficult. We have developed a solution to this problem.        One thing I have learned from my experience is that it does not matter what league you are coaching, from amateur kids to professional football, we all want our team to win and amateur coaches also want to use technology to improve team and player performance.","Less than $1M","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/revenue_range/r_00000000","2014","£105,858","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_total/coacher","Apps, Software, Sports","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/apps-2683","Active","https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/coacher","£105,858","Nov 26, 2014","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_at/coacher","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/funding_total/coacher","Private","Seed","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_type/coacher","1-10","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/people/field/organization.companies/num_employees_enum/coacher","Apps, Soccer, Sports","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/categories/apps","Sheffield, Sheffield, United Kingdom","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/location_identifiers/sheffield-sheffield","Coacher is a web/mobile app for football coaches to collect game and training data and analyse it with intelligent statistics.","—",,1681292005471,"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 09:33:25 GMT","VA8C1zYBLOQp14o4cGkZ","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organization.companies/b5026de0afcda8b38e9fbb759187ca45?pageId=9_a_dcde7499-1663-44b4-b51c-4c5c9bb454d6","9"

DF2020 Limited","Freddie McMahon, John Rawlings","https://www.crunchbase.com/person/freddie-mcmahon","df2020.com","http://df2020.com","For Profit","info@df2020.com","Df2020 have identified a huge, transformative opportunity – the digitisation of regulation, which currently costs the world in excess of USD 5 trillion a year to administer. The current state of regulations across every country is based upon paper-based documents, which are interpreted by each public and private organization, resulting with high administration costs, whilst cultivating many types of risks because of the variety of interpretations. An Australian in-depth study (Unleashing Productivity), by Deloitte, estimated that it costs AUD 94bn to administer and comply with Australian federal, state, and local government rules. This equates to circa 6% of Australia’s GDP (Gross Domestic Product). The equivalent annual cost of regulation to the UK economy is GDP 170bn, for the USA economy the cost is USD 1,286bn, and for the world economy the cost is USD 5,236bn.          After extensive research and development, we can now digitise rule-based knowledge such as regulations and procedures. Our approach from the outset, has been to develop a universal and unifying language with embedded methods to transcend from the monologue to the dialogue of rule-based knowledge traditionally found in paper-based documents or equivalent. This quest has been about the shift of treating rule-based knowledge as an intangible to a tangible, working and measurable asset. Our journey has transversed across public and private sectors to ensure our approach was universal in the way it could codify increasing complexity, whilst masking this complexity from the human interaction. Just as importantly, we have automatically generated an audit trail of the human interaction for safeguarding people and organisations. The biggest value comes from the standardisation of dialogue-data, which enables continuous intelligence, benchmarks, patterns and predictions to be delivered in an accurate and timely manner for learnings at the edge.         Our technology covers: RegTech, White-box Algorithms, Dialogue-Step Orchestration (contextual data input, image, picture, pickup codes, adaptive cars); Digital Agents (stateless software services similar in concept to Agent-Based Models), Azure Cloud, SaaS, new form of Big Data (one dimensional dialogue-strings), Compliance Automation, Analytics, APIs, Progressive Web Apps,  access from multiple channels, and AI/ML.","Less than $1M","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/revenue_range/r_00000000","Feb 11, 2014","£250,000","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_total/df2020-limited","Artificial Intelligence, Data and Analytics, Information Technology, Science and Engineering, Software","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/artificial-intelligence-e551","Active","https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/df2020-limited","£365,000","Apr 30, 2016","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_at/df2020-limited","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/funding_total/df2020-limited","Private","Seed","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_type/df2020-limited","1-10","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/people/field/organization.companies/num_employees_enum/df2020-limited","Artificial Intelligence, Information Services, Information Technology, Software","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/categories/artificial-intelligence","London, England, United Kingdom","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/location_identifiers/london-england","Df2020 regtech digitises regulation and procedures through a universal and unifying blend of codification, interaction and measurement.","—",,1681292005471,"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 09:33:25 GMT","KVzbAkrpQCMqAVH8IEny","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organization.companies/b5026de0afcda8b38e9fbb759187ca45?pageId=10_a_e0b98efc-93f2-4b9f-bf5f-fa5d799e7b7b","10"

FloodKit","Mike Haigh","https://www.crunchbase.com/person/mike-haigh","floodkit.co.uk/","http://floodkit.co.uk/","For Profit","info@floodkit.co.uk","First; it is clear that there are millions of people in the UK who could benefit from affordable flood protection. There are products in the marketplace which offer flood protection of course, but they tend to address specific problems, such as a door or an airbrick, rather than the whole range of potential water ingress points confronting the average householder, and they are too expensive to attract a large proportion of the people who need them.        In addition, it is obvious that, in a situation where a neighbourhood is threatened by a sudden flood emergency, there will only ever be one way in which the majority of properties may be protected and that is if each householder is able to protect his own property. No government body could hope to deploy enough resources fast enough to compete.        The FloodKit concept is to empower the householder to protect his own home by equipping him with the tools to do that at an affordable price. The kit is designed to provide a complete and comprehensive set of flood protection products for use by a householder in an emergency. The products have all been rigorously tested, are easy to use and proven to work at least as well as many far more expensive items currently on the market. Taken together with the advice offered to homeowners in a useful DVD as part of the kit, identifying all of the things that he may do to improve his chances against flooding, a community response can be developed.","$1M to $10M","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/revenue_range/r_00001000","2014","£135,550","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_total/floodkit","Commerce and Shopping, Government and Military, Professional Services","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/commerce-and-shopping","Active","https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/floodkit","£318,120","Oct 17, 2014","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_at/floodkit","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/funding_total/floodkit","Private","Seed","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_type/floodkit","1-10","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/people/field/organization.companies/num_employees_enum/floodkit","Consulting, Marketplace, Public Safety","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/categories/consulting","Stourbridge, Dudley, United Kingdom","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/location_identifiers/stourbridge-dudley","The FloodKit Concept is a grand title for an elementary set of ideas.","—",,1681292005471,"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 09:33:25 GMT","LgbNjTYgvINzFUw3kyJq","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organization.companies/b5026de0afcda8b38e9fbb759187ca45?pageId=11_a_0a2073d4-3d48-71ed-28d0-82f829b3f8bf","11"

Although spreadsheets are flexible, sharing is difficult, changes cannot be tracked and are not auditable.        Karma combines the powerful flexibility of spreadsheets with the rigid robustness of enterprise business administration systems. Karma is a unique platform using spreadsheets for modeling business logic and defining the UI of applications. Karma also keeps customization flexible in the well-known world of spreadsheets.

Takestock.com was created to be an online trading platform to make it easy for owners of stock to sell their unwanted items and to find a buyer efficiently rather than turning to scrap as an option. Takestock is initially focussing on the food manufacturing & agricultural sectors where 600,000 tonnes of food are wasted each year in the UK alone.          They are an eCommerce platform and believe the future solution to distributed unwanted stock is an e market place. That is why they do not advertise on behalf of brands, publish content or produce editorials for the trades they operate in. They focus on trading and helping you turn unwanted stock into cash. Takestock was set up by 4 founders who have a wide range of experience across multiple tech & food sectors. They think it is unacceptable that nearly £1Bn in food is wasted each year in the UK and they intend to make an impact on that at Takestock.","Less than $1M","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/revenue_range/r_00000000","Jun 3, 2014","£300,000","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_total/takestock-com","Agriculture and Farming, Commerce and Shopping, Financial Services, Food and Beverage, Internet Services, Lending and Investments, Sustainability","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/agriculture-and-farming","Closed","https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/takestock-com","£300,000","Sep 1, 2015","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_at/takestock-com","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/funding_total/takestock-com","Private","Seed","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_type/takestock-com","1-10","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/people/field/organization.companies/num_employees_enum/takestock-com","Agriculture, E-Commerce, Food and Beverage, Internet, Trading Platform, Waste Management","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/categories/agriculture","Newbury, West Berkshire, United Kingdom","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/location_identifiers/newbury-west-berkshire","Like an eBay for the food industry, we enable unwanted stock sellers to trade out rather than waste food.","—",,1681292005471,"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 09:33:25 GMT","qDJZVt4sqUC4P08DvRuf","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organization.companies/b5026de0afcda8b38e9fbb759187ca45?pageId=12_a_25370932-2589-66f8-301b-85ad58f486c7","12"

It will allow food delivery businesses to borrow and lend drivers from one another at short notice. In addition, GPS tracking will provide full visibility of all orders.         One member generates revenue from otherwise redundant resource while the other is able to keep their customer satisfied.        Food delivery businesses can't always predict when there will be a surge in the number of orders received and as such struggle to meet customer expectations with timely deliveries.        One of the key contributors to this is the limited access to delivery drivers. Further, the majority don't have access to an affordable solution to track their drivers which then makes the dispatch process inefficient.        The Delivery Club technology platform is being designed to tackle both of these challenges, providing a holistic solution.        With the comfort that they can access drivers when needed, we believe these businesses would be more inclined to increase their marketing spend and grow their businesses. Further, they would have the ability to earn money towards the cost of their delivery drivers when they would otherwise be idle. The GPS tracking would allow them to run a more efficient dispatch process and increase customer satisfaction levels.        Overall, food delivery businesses should run more efficiently, ultimately improving their profitability.        Delivery Club intends to disrupt the food delivery market.","Less than $1M","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/revenue_range/r_00000000","Nov 1, 2014","€150,000","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_total/deliverycube","Commerce and Shopping, Food and Beverage, Software, Transportation","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/commerce-and-shopping","Active","https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/deliverycube","$391,269","Nov 16, 2015","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_at/deliverycube","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/funding_total/deliverycube","Private","Seed","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_type/deliverycube","1-10","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/people/field/organization.companies/num_employees_enum/deliverycube","E-Commerce, Logistics, Restaurants, Software","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/categories/e-commerce-275d","London, England, United Kingdom","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/location_identifiers/london-england","Delivery Cube is a technology consulting firm that specialises in developing solutions for large multichannel retailers and e-commerce.","—",,1681292005471,"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 09:33:25 GMT","Rja9xCPrl23Yjtzowy0d","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organization.companies/b5026de0afcda8b38e9fbb759187ca45?pageId=12_a_25370932-2589-66f8-301b-85ad58f486c7","12"

In the UK alone 41m donate £10b every year, 10% to just two organisations, both research charities. Crowdfunding grew from $6.1b in 2013 to £34b in 2015. Europe accounts for 18% of the crowdfunding market led by the UK, which grew 98% in 2015. Meanwhile, Charity fundraising is changing with crowdfunding emerging. At the same time, new regulations are changing the regular giving landscape meaning many donors will be reviewing their giving and browsing new ways of funding areas they care about.  We see Crowd.Science as the perfect place on line where people can find and support research that resonates with them.         Crowd.Science was founded by Natalie Jonk and launched September 2014.

Customers include investment banks and asset managers including hedge funds, CTAs, and family offices. The algorithms underpinning the AlgoDynamix analytics engine use primary data sources (the world’s global financial exchanges) and proprietary unsupervised machine learning technology. The analytics engine detects market anomalies and anticipates directional price movements hours or days in advance of the event.         Unlike competitive solutions, the real-time analysis does not rely on historical data or previous disruptive events.        AlgoDynamix was started in 2013 and incorporated in January 2014 with software based on many years of academic research at the University of Cambridge, where the team met. Offices are located in Cambridge (UK) and London.","—",,"Jan 20, 2014","—",,"Artificial Intelligence, Data and Analytics, Financial Services, Science and Engineering, Software","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/artificial-intelligence-e551","Active","https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/algodynamix-ltd","—","Jun 6, 2016","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_at/algodynamix-ltd",,"Private","Venture - Series Unknown","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_type/algodynamix-ltd","1-10","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/people/field/organization.companies/num_employees_enum/algodynamix-ltd","Analytics, Artificial Intelligence, Finance, Financial Services, FinTech","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/categories/analytics","London, England, United Kingdom","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/location_identifiers/london-england","Deep data risk analytics platform used by investment banks and asset managers including hedge funds and family offices.","—",,1681292005472,"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 09:33:25 GMT","86hzM0K73SgojIZuMQY7","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organization.companies/b5026de0afcda8b38e9fbb759187ca45?pageId=13_a_3d98898d-54b2-d9c8-1905-35142c767c05","13"

We use a simple, fun and free process: Do, Think and Share to support people who’d like to use creativity to express themselves, get a bit more of a spring in their step, or connect better with others.                 We believe passionately that everyone has the right to a creative life, that we are all instinctively creative but that often gets knocked out of us at school or work. With partners we are developing simple ways of helping people do stuff again, to just have a go without worrying about being good at something or being an expert.        We work in a number of areas:        With the arts and cultural sector (including the BBC on Get Creative) to ensure everyday creativity is encouraged and celebrated across the UK.        With employers to bring fun and regular creativity to the workplace.        With towns and cities to see what happens when you catalyse larger numbers of people to unleash their potential.        And with people effected by stress, depression, anxiety or other wellbeing issues to explore how everyday creativity can make a positive contribution to individual lives across the UK.        Sign up to our weekly Monday Challenge here        We hope you enjoy exploring our site.

Zettabox can be used by anyone, but it has been built for business, with dashboard controls essential for management of content within a corporation or team. And Zettabox has been designed with data protection built in to guarantee compliance with the new, upcoming EU regulation.         When the team began building Zettabox, the total amount of worldwide data saved on networks had surpassed the 1,000 Exabytes and entered a new era of sizing storage – Zettabytes (1 X 1021). Zettabox was created to help companies and individual keep control of that surging amount of content.        The cloud team sharing and storage market is currently dominated by American-domiciled companies, which means the majority of users’ data is stored in the US or is stored in European data centres that are accessible by the US government (because those data centres are owned by US-domiciled companies). There is impending EU regulation requiring companies doing business in Europe to know where their data is stored and to be able to communicate that to their customers. Zettabox was launched as a European alternative to the US companies that are providing team sharing and cloud-based storage services.        Zettabox provides data protection by design, to help you and your company comply with the European GDPR regulation.

Over the past 12 months the group has invested heavily in capex, operational platforms, I.T infrastructure, technology and new products to ensure the continuation of its ambitious growth strategy as part of its 20/20 vision.        DW3 is passionate about investing in, and leveraging its technology and I.T platforms to deliver industry leading levels of business analytics, along with a best in class online customer experience.

Competitors like Qlikview, let you visualise data in many different ways but sales reps still have to interpret what they see, to work out what to do. They use machine learning to automate complex tasks like gap analysis, change-point detection, and churn prediction at a fraction of the cost of an in-house data scientist.     They do all this in seconds across thousands of products and thousands of customers, and push recommendations directly to sales rep’s inboxes.

It uses sophisticated algorithms to classify MOOCs, videos, OpenCourseWare, tutorials and screencasts. We provide a rich set of tools to enable users to plan their learning journey.        There has been a recent massive expansion in educational resources being made available online in a wide variety of formats. This is disrupting the traditional ways in which people are educated both academically and professionally. A major part of this change is the unbundling of the educational experience such that people are using a much greater mixture of providers and methods of learning rather than the single channel of a traditional institution. With so much content, so many platforms and different approaches coming online in a short space of time people need a way to find the appropriate resources for their own situation and learning style – traditional search, such as google is not helpful for this. Our aim is to provide a context for these resources of variegated and unknown quality so that people use the resources that are most helpful in complementing their formal studies or professional development.        edspire is incubated by the Isis software incubator, part of Isis Innovation, the technology transfer company of the University of Oxford.","$1M to $10M","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/revenue_range/r_00001000","2014","—",,"Education, Internet Services, Software","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/education-c9b5","Closed","https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/edspire","—","Mar 1, 2013","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_at/edspire",,"Private","Venture - Series Unknown","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_type/edspire","1-10","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/people/field/organization.companies/num_employees_enum/edspire","EdTech, Education, Internet, MOOC, Search Engine, Skill Assessment, Training","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/categories/edtech","Oxford, Oxfordshire, United Kingdom","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/location_identifiers/oxford-oxfordshire","edspire is a search engine that offers online learning resources to its users.","—",,1681292005472,"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 09:33:25 GMT","MJzp4nuPaTG17klkhdC7","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organization.companies/b5026de0afcda8b38e9fbb759187ca45?pageId=17_a_1bcc8bd4-49d0-4afa-1eab-0492e7f34717","17"

EDTA is a chemical which can inhibit the development of such biofilms.        Biofilms are a major problem for human infections and medical device related infections due to their becoming resistant to antibiotics, with the result being wounds that are slow to heal, or not healing/remaining open.
