Now I have it, I’m in love with it. I am in project management, so on top of managing myself I have to manage a lot of others. While I have to-do systems such as Trello and Asana, most of those to-dos are spurred from emails (or an email that has a lot of information)."" ""I’ve tried setting up folders and didn’t work. It made it so hard until now. Drag, simply put, is awesome. I can now run my inbox like I do my tasks inside Trello.” “We’ve previously used tools such as Wunderlist, Asana, Evernote, Todoist, Any.do, Trello and Sortd however they’re all focused on managing Tasks inside a tool. I need to manage my tasks inside my email. Booooom, then Drag came a long. Honestly, it’s the most productive Chrome extension I’ve used in years. Thanks Drag, I’m an official Dragster now!” “Email is the perennial problem for me, because I want to use it as a todo list, but I also want a zero inbox. I’m a huge fan of Trello, it is the most productive workspace I have today.  So when I saw Drag, the light went on and I am now unable to live without it.” “We’ve tried them all from Trello, Asana, Evernote through to Sortd and others. Drag complements my use of Trello perfectly. I don’t want all Tasks inside Trello so to run my Gmail separately works amazingly well.” How does Drag compare to other tools?  If you’re considering what Task Management or Project Management tools you should be using in your spare time and improve what you’re doing, there’s a lot of options.  From regular old spreadsheets to manage Tasks to specific Kanban boards of software, sales and marketing. There are dozens of solutions (we love Trello) and Drag works perfectly with them.

In the future, we'll help people find jobs at all of the best companies. Looking for a job is a frustrating experience. It's incredibly hard to find a good match. Job adverts lack useful information like salary and diversity data. Companies sometimes never respond. There’s a lack of friendly-support in those tough moments of rejection … the list goes on.

So we set out to build a candidate-first job search: one that is laser-focused on providing the best experience for candidates.

But it’s impossible to battle a giant like LinkedIn if you try and compete on all jobs from Day 1. So we chose tech companies as our first move.

We refurbish and rebox used devices into premium phones - making it easier, faster, and more trustworthy. So fewer perfectly good phones go to waste. And one by one, we can save millions more from landfill. Our circular business model – rebox, rehome, repeat – isn’t just designed to give our customers better value, but make a positive impact on the environment and society.  We don’t just reward people for reboxing. We reward the planet by planting 10 trees every time we buy or sell a device and paying to offset each phone’s lifetime CO2 emissions, which helps to fund a whole range of projects to cut CO2. Our goal is to try and make every phone we rehome not just carbon neutral, but carbon positive if we can. We've come to shake up a dated and boring category. To solve inefficiencies. To redefine recommerce. To challenge the status quo. To liberate people from their addiction to linear, and create a circular economy that rewards them for making greener choices and helping to replenish the planet. One device at a time.

In partnership with leading international corporations, CORE POWER aims to deliver durable zero-emission energy for floating industrial production and deep-sea shipping. Advanced atomic technologies are set to create the first sustainable zero-emission energy system for ocean transportation and represents an economic opportunity worth $27 billion by 2040. It can form the start of a ‘second atomic era’, where climate change is the main driver of powerful, inexpensive, and safe new energy solutions.  Over the next few decades as many as 60,000 ships must transition from combustion of fossil fuels to zero-emission propulsion. The UN’s maritime agency IMO has mandated with unanimous approval from 174 countries that shipping must reduce emissions by 50% of the 2008 total, before 2050. This means an actual emission reduction of almost 90%, by 2050. The m-MSR can achieve that goal alone, by producing green sustainable fuels for the smaller ships and powering the largest ships. Zero emissions come as standard. Advanced atomic technologies are like atomic battery packs. Small, with few moving parts, it can be a third cheaper to run than a large fossil fuelled engine. It massively reduces waste, and is fuelled-for-life, avoiding proliferation of spent fuel. Advanced atomic technologies can be inherently walk-away safe. Atomic reactors produce heat. Therefore, the coolant is the key to safety. This is the very definition of passive walk-away safety which will create a positive public opinion.

Why use C-CAS?  Children are great, no question but early years and school-age childcare is expensive.  The C-CAS scheme helps to make childcare more affordable and easier to manage.   What exactly is C-CAS? The scheme is essentially an online account, mobile app and marketplace.  Employers can support their employees by providing an interest-free 12-month loan, which is paid in to their online account, to then be used specifically for childcare costs. Can everyone use C-CAS?  Yes.  Whilst the scheme has been developed as a voluntary employee benefit, you can still use the scheme, even if your employer doesn’t offer C-CAS as a benefit. How long does the loan last?  The interest-free loan is to be repaid over a maximum of 12 months, but the money does not need to be used within the year, which means you can build up a balance to pay for all those unexpected childcare costs. What can I use the loan for?  The scheme can be used with Ofsted (or equivalent) registered childcare providers or companies/organisations who provide childcare activities, such as after-school & holiday clubs, sports & activity clubs, as well as tutors, which gives parents significant flexibility.  How easy is it to use? From the minute the loan-sum lands in your account, you will be able to choose, book and pay for all of your childcare services from the very same digital portal.  We have endeavoured to put the emphasis on simplicity; ‘One Payment. One Portal. One Solution’. How can I find out further information about C-CAS?

I believe I have a responsibility to share my story with others so that those who are trapped can see that we have it in us and we can do anything. I set this up so that I can help those who can't ask for themselves, or who go unnoticed, or those who can't file a police report. Not everyone is able to have their abusers convicted and people in those positions don't get access to the same resources that someone who has gone through a court will. I have spoken to many survivors and victims who have expressed these ideas or thoughts and I have personal experience in this issue so I know what helps but not many people are able to rationally think things through and find the same resources or even have the knowledge of the same resources. I have also spoken to many people who have lost their creative motivation due to their circumstances and I believe that it is important for the future generations to come that we showcase the talents of our survivors. I have my own separate fashion line but I don’t have any funding for any of this and I have spent my own money on everything so far. I am already supporting survivors on a daily basis since launching the project and business, the business itself has had some great feedback and interest from people. I am determined to help people and I am determined to show people that abuse does not end our lives. I have been doing all I can to make my presence known on every platform. I have been doing informational videos on YouTube to help people understand abuse and a few how to videos for surviving etc. I have had a really tough time the past few years getting abused by my own family and being forced into a marriage. This kind of stuff isn’t right and I want to use this business as an opportunity to rectify a lot of issues I feel strongly  about. I’ve got the support of many individuals and I just need the financial help to be able to actually do some of the things. First of, I want to stock some of the Domestic Abuse Survivor clothing line and give some free merchandise to survivors to show them that they are not going unnoticed and that I appreciate them stepping forward. This will be a great way to start the difficult conversations among people as well. I am currently working on a website where survivors will be able to submit their art work or creative work or even their own story as a method of self expression. I will need some of the money to create this website and make sure it’s completely secure and safeguards the people who choose to submit work through it. I will also use the annual amount to set up charity events for survivors and supporters such as fashion shows, community building, networking, etc. To help provide survivors with an opportunity to grow and move forward in their lives in a healthy manner. I will also use the money to help me build a team of professionals who will be able to safeguard the survivors I’m coming across in different aspects of their lives.",,2019-03-25,day,,,,"Clothing and Apparel, Commerce and Shopping, Design, Information Technology, Media and Entertainment, Other",Active,2021-06-01,,,,,
