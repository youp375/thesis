Veteran founded and owned we focus on supporting users in remote, exposed on challenging environments, including police, service personnel, first responders and NGOs. We’re active in both the UK and US.  Hybrid human-machine teams will be much more effective in protecting assets, people & planet at scale. For that to happen, we need our technology to be able to operate without depending on human attention or on vulnerable infrastructure. We specialise in advanced artificial intelligence (AI) for cameras and GNSS-denied navigation for manned and unmanned systems.     Real time remote monitoring is difficult to achieve with people alone. The areas are often huge and distant, meaning hard-working maintenance, security or safety staff have poor coverage with long response times. Pipeline security, anti-poaching, asset integrity monitoring and border patrol are a few examples. Whilst we (humankind) have developed an impressive array of technologies, including drones and ground sensors, these remain tools to use at long range. These tools are dependent on: 1) human attention to make best use of them and 2) infrastructure to support them, with communications and positional information in particular.  GPS has become increasingly easy to jam and to spoof. Not only that but the orbital infrastructure itself is at direct risk of vandalism. Archangel Imaging provides a complimentary solution stack to enable human-machine team work in the real world. These make machines smarter, more resilient in a changing situation and easier to work with in a human workflow.

Outfield is a precision orchard management system that provides growers with fruit counts and year round variability maps. By providing key insights on orchard performance, we help growers become more efficient, more profitable, and more environmentally friendly.  Yield estimates are crucial for all aspects of fruit growing, from maximising orchard production to agreeing sales contracts. Growers estimate yields manually based on around 0.5% of their trees. The unreliable and limited data they collect leads to 20% average errors in estimated yield per orchard. This reduces output, efficiency and profit while increasing environmental damage. Outfield growers have less than 10% error in their yield estimates. Our growers use inexpensive off-the-shelf drones, loaded with flight plans from Outfield. At the touch of a button, they make a 30-minute automated drone flight covering thousands of trees. The images are sent to Outfield’s cloud based platform and processed using bespoke image recognition algorithms. Maps and insights are returned to growers within 24hrs. This strategy allows Outfield to deploy a scalable SAAS model. Our fruit-level data platform has been developed and trialled with apple and pear growers on 3 continents, and our MVP is being used right now by paying beta-test growers in the UK, New Zealand, and South Africa. Growers have praised the unparalleled flexibility, speed and ease of drone data acquisition. We are now looking for investment to drive our growth and to scale our product to meet the growing demand. Our team is ready to build and expand international presence, to broaden our service offering with new product features, and to move into new market segments in other fruit crops.

Landlords can top-up their protection with Boost. A solution that offers up to six weeks of extra protection along with fast cost recovery the day after charges are agreed with tenants. It can be used to add protection to a traditional deposit, or on top of flatfair’s No Deposit. Everything is handled through flatfair’s easy-to-use online platform, where tenants and landlords can handle end of tenancy charges quickly and fairly. And if they can’t agree, government-backed independent adjudicators are on hand to help out. flatfair's technology makes life easier for agents too, from registration and change of sharer right through to check-out – they’ll also get a commission for bringing on new tenants and landlords too.",,2016-11-01,month,11000000,USD,11000000,"Financial Services, Real Estate",Active,2019-08-14,,,,,

Gameway empowers users to enjoy discovering the best games on their phone through simplifying the way mobile gaming content is presented to them. Additionally Gameway is set to provide game developers with new tools to enhance their work and increase engagement with fans across the globe. Our Challenge: Mobile gaming is growing at a phenomenal rate with over 1000 games released per week across Google’s Play Store and Apple’s App Store. There are 3.4 million apps and games currently available on the Play Store store alone. With so much choice, it’s no wonder it takes users between 15-60 minutes to manually find a game they may be interested in. Even when a user does find a game, 72% are uninstalled after being played just twice. By using an app store, users see less than 1% of the games available to them, the majority of these from the large studios with bigger marketing budgets. Why Now: Another 1 billion people are expected to gain access to the internet in the next 3 years through mobile. Growing up truly mobile-first they’ll discover all their entertainment, including games via their phones. Mobile gaming has reached the point of max-saturation, the app stores are overfilled and advertising is pulling customers in every direction to download games.

Recent surveys indicate that 66% of UK Millennials are spontaneous enough to book a flight departing within 72 hours and 83% of the same group are willing to change their schedule if they find a flight to a cool destination under £50. SpeediFly exploits this emerging trend for impulsive decision-making to turn itself into the ultimate catalyst for spontaneous travel for Millennials.  The current problem  on the market is that booking travel is an impersonal and price-centric lonely process. None of the old-fashioned travel platforms make proper use of data analytics for recommendation purposes. All you see on such platforms is “cheap”, ""low-cost”, “discounted”, “limited-time” deals – it is all about the price and nothing about the experience itself. In addition, travel platforms are not social, making it hard for young people to organize group trips as they are now used to doing with Uber or Airbnb.  SpeediFly is a direct response to this problem. By asking users about their interests and leveraging data from social media, SpeediFly makes people-centric and personalized last-minute travel recommendations to individuals and groups of people. SpeediFly lets users invite their Facebook friends, build in-app travel communities, invite others to specific trips, start group bookings and split fares at the end, just like on Uber. By tracking users' in-app activities, our system is capable of predicting what they are likely to book. This allows SpeediFly to make customized recommendations based on user behavior instead of simply trying to sell the cheapest available flights.",Less than $1M,2016-01-01,year,188000,EUR,212244,"Apps, Events, Media and Entertainment, Mobile, Software, Travel and Tourism",Active,2016-06-13,,,,,

Their ideal client is the one who needs to sell to or provide its service with their IoT/M2M devices in different countries and don’t want to deal with different carrier integrations, SIM cards, SIM configurations and invoices. 1oT provides its clients with one invoice, one connectivity management platform, and one eSIM/SIM solution, helping clients to drive their business globally with one end-to-end connectivity solution.  In 2019, 1oT launched the future technology of SIM cards: eSIM. Technically known as eUICC, eSIM is an unlocked SIM card that enables clients to swap carrier services “over-the-air” securely and at a push of a button. Clients can choose one mobile carrier service today (e.g. telecom I) and decide to swap to another one tomorrow (e.g. telecom II), without changing the physical SIM. In addition to 1oT’s connectivity services, the company has developed an end-to-end IoT connectivity platform, called 1oT Terminal, for clients to control their SIMs & eSIM via a self-service user interface. The platform comes with many value-added services such as API, reporting, diagnostics, and much more. In the future they will add artificial intelligence and machine learning features to the platform that help their customers to get the best possible carrier deals for their eSIM cards. 1oT is part of, and co-founded by Mobi Solutions group (http://mobisolutions.com) which among other things was a key developer of the original Skype mobile application, as well as launching the carrier billing service Fortumo, (https://fortumo.com, backed by Intel Capital), and Messente (https://messente.com), the critical business SMS platform service global clients.",Less than $1M,2016-01-01,year,,,,"Hardware, Internet Services, Software",Active,2016-06-01,,,,,
