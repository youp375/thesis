They expect their packages to arrive the next, or even the same day. It all relies on drivers, and means that owning a car opens up a world of earning potential.        But not everyone has access to the right kind of car. That’s where Splend comes in. To date, we’ve helped people from all walks of life become their own bosses, with not just a car, but the tools to earn even more money, and become better drivers.        Splend was launched in Sydney in 2015 after our founder, Chris King, realised that too many drivers were lacking both the cars and knowledge they needed to really thrive. It was a problem, but it could be fixed.        Now, four years later, Splend is able to offer freedom to all kinds of people through car rental, and rent-to-own options. But we don’t stop there. We provide unprecedented levels of support and training, to help our members make the most of their time on the road.        And, by providing members with data and analytics, we give them the opportunity to become more profitable and safer drivers. All that, plus the chance to connect with other drivers and be part of a growing community, making driving a more sustainable way of earning an income.        Splend has enabled students, retirees, former refugees and single parents to find work they enjoy, and that fits their lifestyle. Equally, we’ve provided exciting opportunities for first-time buyers to own a brand new car. We couldn’t be prouder of what we’ve achieved so far, and we’re only just getting started.        Whatever your reason for wanting a car, Splend has it covered, with all of the support you need to turn your dream into a reality.","$10M to $50M","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/revenue_range/r_00010000","Jul 1, 2015","$150,000,000","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_total/splend-3","Financial Services, Other, Transportation","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/financial-services-d7b6","Active","https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/splend-3","$438,200,000","Apr 20, 2022","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_at/splend-3","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/funding_total/splend-3","Private","Private Equity","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_type/splend-3","101-250","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/people/field/organization.companies/num_employees_enum/splend-3","Automotive, Leasing, Sharing Economy, Transportation","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/categories/automotive","London, England, United Kingdom","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/location_identifiers/london-england","We’re not about cars.

We build member-owned and governed decentralised network platforms for the peer-to-peer exchange of tokenised value between network members. Our ethos and architecture is grounded in protocol, peer-to-peer architecture, removing friction and market inefficiencies, strong security guarantees and interoperable exchange across platforms to build a peer-to-peer ecosystem for market infrastructure. Our focus is capital markets; we work with firms that have the ambition to reinvent the industry's business models.        Our technology is p2p network platforms and protocol first - protocol suite, software that implements those protocols and provides client software and infrastructure for p2p networks. Its based on Ethereum and we call it Autonity - the protocol, the Geth-based client.        We use our technology to build p2p networks and dFMI.        P2p networks are private, member-owned and governed networks that enable peer-to-peer transfer of financial value and automation of contractual and fiduciary operations without reliance on trusted third-parties. Such decentralised networks can interact with one another, creating a wider ecosystem of value and leveraging the network effect, and they can form part of a dFMI.        dFMI is a new concept, one that builds on the security and resilience guarantees of distributed ledger and systems engineering to provide a platform for tokenising value and transferring its ownership between participants on that or, by cross-platform exchange, on other platforms.        We believe that our technology will drive adoption of a next-generation dFMI where intermediaries are removed, incentive structures encourage self-regulation, and risks are mitigated and reduced to the maximum. dFMI doesn't just provide a cryptographically secure environment for market participants to transact, it provides a peer-to-peer model that removes financial intermediaries and engenders a wider ecosystem for value transfer across platforms and pre- post-trade processes. dFMI works to mitigate concentration and liquidity risk, reduce settlement cycles to real-time, remove friction, and lower the transaction cost of economic exchange.        Clearmatics is a company with a strong belief in the open source movement and good ties to the Ethereum community. We also work closely with the Ethereum Foundation, and are an active member of the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance (EEA).","—",,"Feb 6, 2015","$12,000,000","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_total/clearmatics","Financial Services, Information Technology, Other, Science and Engineering, Software","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/financial-services-d7b6","Active","https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/clearmatics","$13,261,916","Oct 10, 2018","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_at/clearmatics","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/funding_total/clearmatics","Private","Series A","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_type/clearmatics","11-50","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/people/field/organization.companies/num_employees_enum/clearmatics","Blockchain, Ethereum, FinTech, Information Technology, Software Engineering","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/categories/blockchain","London, England, United Kingdom","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/location_identifiers/london-england","Designing protocols and build platforms for decentralised Financial Market Infrastructure (dFMI).","—",,1681292640504,"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 09:44:00 GMT","fuz6vz6Hd4afaXDd69Lz","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organization.companies/14260cdad6a834e1ebb6ac845be87a04?pageId=2_a_7695bd05-34f9-52ed-ce66-ef4c3bad5ec4","2"

The Alphamer technology is based on ""programmable immunity"" in which chemically synthesised molecules redirect naturally occurring antibodies to selected pathogens to fight the infection. The molecules have two distinct parts: one end binds a cell-surface target on the pathogen using an aptamer whereas the other end presents specific epitopes that attach to the circulating antibodies. It has been demonstrated that Alphamers have the potential to redirect pre-existing antibodies to bacteria in a specific manner and trigger an immediate antibacterial immune response, so clearing the infection.         Centauri Therapeutics’ strategy is to redirect naturally occurring antibodies to target disease. Centauri Therapeutics' unique Chemistry Platform provides a flexible scaffold to enable the synthesis of specific Alphamers. These are bifunctional molecules which present a selective cell binding moiety as well as an epitope that recruits pre-existing antibodies, resulting in cell killing.         Centauri Therapeutics believes their technology is widely applicable in the treatment of life threatening infectious diseases. Companies with an interest in accessing Centauri’s Alphamer technology or with an interest in one of their current projects, are warmly encouraged to contact them to discuss partnering opportunities.         In order to drive success in the important area of immuno-oncology, Centauri Therapeutics has established a joint venture, Avvinity Therapeutics, with Horizon Discovery in March 2016. Avvinity combines Centauri’s Alphamer Technology with the gene editing and oncology expertise of Horizon.         In addition to Centauri Therapeutics' immuno-oncology joint venture, Centauri maintains a strong network of collaborators in the areas of aptamer selection, drug discovery, chemistry and immunology.","—",,"2015","£24,000,000","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_total/centauri-therapeutics","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/biotechnology-0400","Active","https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/centauri-therapeutics","$42,606,977","Feb 16, 2022","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_at/centauri-therapeutics","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/funding_total/centauri-therapeutics","Private","Series A","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_type/centauri-therapeutics","11-50","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/people/field/organization.companies/num_employees_enum/centauri-therapeutics","Biotechnology, Genetics, Health Care, Medical, Therapeutics","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/categories/biotechnology","Sandwich, Kent, United Kingdom","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/location_identifiers/sandwich-kent","Centauri Therapeutics is a UK-based biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of life threatening diseases.","—",,1681292640505,"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 09:44:00 GMT","4DZnGg2BAwy8rSHNSVBN","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organization.companies/14260cdad6a834e1ebb6ac845be87a04?pageId=3_a_7567682a-fd4a-41a8-a65d-69d12cb51b46","3"

Kamma have solved this business problem through building technology and data methodologies to aggregate, cleanse and map Property Licensing in real time, something that nobody else in the market has been able to do. This has manifested in multiple client facing products across diverse markets including Letting Agents, Surveyors, Insurance Providers, Debt Collectors and Mortgage Lenders.

Secondly, layering new products onto our expanding datastore, allowing existing and new clients to gain deeper insights into the PRS.

The annual subscription model itself opens space for artists to make up to 300 times higher income compared to music streaming. And by applying a powerful combination of all toolkits, musicians can organize concerts and shows, sell music without financial risks and losses as well as build and manage successful music careers; fans can take part in the creative process of music creation of their favorite artists; and record labels and concert promoters can use Show4me to promote their artists.              Show4me is the project of the UK-based company Wefuture Ltd. It has started and operated since 2015 as a concert crowdfunding platform until the board has decided to expand it into a complete music interaction network to open broader opportunities for the musicians. The goal of Show4me is to level the playing field for musicians and give the opportunity to get a fair reward for their art by building a close relationship with their fans through Show4me direct interaction model.

Yoppie connects consumers with personalised intimate care products, services and information from their mobile devices, all focussed on improving their overall health and menstrual wellbeing. Founded by Daniella Peri, a long-time reproductive health enthusiast, with a background in organisational development, operations and marketing, Daniella launched Yoppie in 2016 with her friend after spotting a gap in the menstrual care market for easily accessible, high quality, organic period care products that could be delivered on a subscription basis. Yoppie launched with just one product - a 100% organic cotton tampon - and quickly expanded to offer pads and liners. Along with a highly visited online health resource for intimate and reproductive healthcare information, the most recent addition to Yoppie’s offering is personalised product recommendations from their range of 100% organic period care and symptom-targeted PMS supplements. All of which is helping to actualise Daniella’s vision of a world where people have access to a range of menstrual care products that conveniently fit into their modern-day lifestyle.","—",,"2015","£2,200,000","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_total/yoppie","Commerce and Shopping, Community and Lifestyle, Health Care","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/commerce-and-shopping","Active","https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/yoppie","£3,400,000","Mar 24, 2021","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_at/yoppie","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/funding_total/yoppie","Private","Seed","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_type/yoppie","11-50","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/people/field/organization.companies/num_employees_enum/yoppie","E-Commerce, Health Care, Lifestyle, Wellness, Women's","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/categories/e-commerce-275d","London, England, United Kingdom","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/location_identifiers/london-england","Yoppie is a menstrual wellness brand, that helps women get access to quality products, align with their menstrual cycle.","—",,1681292640505,"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 09:44:00 GMT","ycFcqL5LLpWGbUyhAb6Z","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organization.companies/14260cdad6a834e1ebb6ac845be87a04?pageId=4_a_0c545458-1e4f-3462-1dc4-b370ed33ff58","4"

Operating globally, with pilots in Automotive, Home and Marine insurance, the software platform helps improve productivity and reduce cost within insurers, whilst providing a much better user experience for end customers.         The customer-centric approach allows insurance customers to interact with their claim in their own time, the web app removes the insurance jargon and thus drastically improves claim cycle times and customer satisfaction.        The platform’s backend service reduces the administration support needed to process a claim. It helps claims handlers focus more on higher value jobs and brokers spend more time on new deals, minimizing the time spent on explanation processes and negotiation with applicants. This increases the productivity of handlers up to four times per day, and gives management good visibility of claims handling metrics - potentially saving an insurer £500 per claim.","—",,"2015","—",,"Financial Services, Software","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/financial-services-d7b6","Active","https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/rightindem","$1,007,281","Sep 21, 2017","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_at/rightindem","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/funding_total/rightindem","Private","Seed","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_type/rightindem","11-50","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/people/field/organization.companies/num_employees_enum/rightindem","Financial Services, Insurance, Software","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/categories/financial-services","Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/location_identifiers/nottingham-nottingham","RightIndem is a white-label insurance claims platform, that works with insurers to enhance claimant's customer experiences.","—",,1681292640505,"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 09:44:00 GMT","vNOeqk1qkjY6TVAk1hzK","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organization.companies/14260cdad6a834e1ebb6ac845be87a04?pageId=4_a_0c545458-1e4f-3462-1dc4-b370ed33ff58","4"

Current treatments mainly target symptoms and the prognosis remains poor. The only effective cure is transplantation of the lungs or heart and lungs, which has associated risks and complications.        Compromised bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor type II (BMPR-II) signalling in endothelial cells plays a pivotal role in the pathobiology PAH, as identified from human genetic studies.        BMP9 and 10 represent circulating ligands that selectively bind and activate BMPR-II receptor complexes on endothelial cells. Administration of exogenous BMP9 has been shown to augment endothelial BMPR-II signalling and reverse PAH in several rodent models of disease.        Our goal is to explore the potential of BMP9 and BMP10 as potential therapies for PAH.        The company follows the semi-virtual model with a hub based in Cambridge, UK.

The words used, phrases chosen, questions asked all impact on success. Yet, throughout our own careers, sales coaching always felt broken.        We would ride along calls and demos, share ideas and feedback, all without a shared reflective view.        And as powerful as coaching continually proves to be, it only accounts for less than 5% of sales managers time.        So,to make sales coaching simple, more time efficient and to amplify the benefits, we built Refract.        By highlighting the decisive and defining moments of these conversations and surfacing coachable insight specific to your business and reps, mistakes and missed opportunities can be remedied. Great moments can be shared amongst the team. The best made available in a searchable library.        Our AI technology delivers personalized insight, based on your business and your reps, showing the actions and words that align with top performers and results.

The company's vision is to change the way you access beauty treatments. Instead of having you call every salon on the high-street to get a time slot that works for you, LeSalon has created an easy to use app where you see all available times in your area, select your therapist and pay online. Their therapists travel to you saving you a lot of time commuting and waiting.        But unlike a booking platform where you take your chances from a range of qualities and prices, LeSalon has standardised the service and fully automated the booking process with their proprietary booking algorithm (avg. matching time < 2 min).        Every therapist who joins the platform goes through a thorough vetting process. This ensures a consistently high-quality service, with more than 95% of treatments rated 5* and recognition from the press - LeSalon has been awarded best manicure in London by Harper's Bazaar.","$1M to $10M","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/revenue_range/r_00001000","Jun 2015","£127,861","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_total/lesalon-beauty-ltd","Apps, Community and Lifestyle, Consumer Goods, Mobile, Real Estate, Software","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/apps-2683","Active","https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/lesalon-beauty-ltd","£285,722","Oct 27, 2016","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_at/lesalon-beauty-ltd","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/funding_total/lesalon-beauty-ltd","Private","Pre-Seed","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_type/lesalon-beauty-ltd","1-10","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/people/field/organization.companies/num_employees_enum/lesalon-beauty-ltd","Beauty, Home Services, Lifestyle, Mobile Apps","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/categories/beauty","London, England, United Kingdom","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/location_identifiers/london-england","LeSalon is delivering a branded, consistent and high-quality at-home beauty service.","—",,1681292640505,"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 09:44:00 GMT","Gl4F5gMeME6C4oF455Gd","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organization.companies/14260cdad6a834e1ebb6ac845be87a04?pageId=6_a_8f913d0b-ad09-86b3-b201-ecdb7c965ea1","6"

Bronze can create fluid, performative and contextualised versions of songs which are playable in all the same environments as current music. Bronze adapts and augments audio beyond the studio and is better suited to applications like AR, VR, short form social media and gaming than “static” music.        Bronze is already being used by some of the world’s most influential artists; Sigur Rós created their  “Route One” album (10 million streams) using Bronze, highly influential artist/producer Jai Paul (Drake, Beyonce) created an ever-changing, infinite version of “Jasmine” https://jaipaul.bronze.ai/ and Philippe Parreno opened the lobby at Museum of Modern Art in NYC with 3-year installation powered by Bronze. In December 2020 Arca (Kanye West, Bjork, Frank Ocean) released 100 unique Bronze-generated versions of her song “Riquiquí” onto all Digital Streaming Platforms. We also just worked with Microsoft on the Xbox X launch, we have a live project with Google and approaches for the automatic generation of short-form audio have been made by Samsung and Tik Tok.

Inflowmatix creates innovative and customer tailored solutions for the steady-state, resilient and energy efficient operation of water supply networks by continuously monitoring and analyzing the fluid dynamics in complex networks. This allows operators to continuously gain unique insight and proactively optimize the dynamic network performance in order to extend the service life of infrastructure assets. Our expertise in modelling the steady and unsteady-state hydraulics of water distribution networks, combined with knowledge and experience in the design and implementation of embedded electronic systems, yield compelling returns on investment for our customers.        Many cities in the world face the problem of ageing infrastructure, increasing population demand and climate change. This combined with increasing regulatory and financial pressure means water utilities are actively seeking novel, integrated and optimized operational strategies for managing leakage, demand and energy efficiency in order to deliver high-quality of service to customers within cost constraints. Water companies and operators are facing unparalleled challenges to meet increasing demand with limited water and financial resources.

Their software converts a user’s full body magnetic resonance scan (MRI) into a 3D virtual model of their body in the cloud. The model is annotated with explanatory information so they can easily explore and learn about different parts of their body.        They provide users with a detailed analysis of their body composition, including accurate volumetric measurements of muscle and fat tissues.

Exhibitions have well and truly withstood the test of time; in fact the world’s first exhibition took place nearly 170 years ago and the number of exhibitions happening each year is increasing all the time, showing no signs of slowing down!        It’s clear why, they provide an unrivalled opportunity for businesses across the world, big and small, to showcase their products & services and build invaluable face to face connections with their customers.        However, with all the huge benefits they bring, they know that exhibiting is expensive and incredibly time consuming. As well as that, exhibition suppliers tend to only specialise in one type of product and can only deliver to certain venues or certain exhibitions at any given time. This all means that exhibitors have no choice but to use lots of different suppliers, leading to lots of lengthy paper order forms, phone calls and emails just to get everything sorted.        They believe that exhibitors deserve a better and easier way to organise their exhibition stands – so they set out to create ExpoCart – the convenient one stop shop platform enabling you to hire and buy all the equipment you need for all major exhibition venues across the UK.","—",,"Jan 2015","£750,000","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_total/expocart","Administrative Services, Commerce and Shopping, Events, Media and Entertainment","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/administrative-services","Active","https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/expocart","£915,670","Mar 16, 2017","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_at/expocart","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/funding_total/expocart","Private","Seed","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_type/expocart","11-50","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/people/field/organization.companies/num_employees_enum/expocart","E-Commerce, Events, Trade Shows","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/categories/e-commerce-275d","London, England, United Kingdom","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/location_identifiers/london-england","ExpoCart is home to the biggest range of products and services for events.","—",,1681292640505,"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 09:44:00 GMT","cKBjzVW6dsGufV6JSRFc","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organization.companies/14260cdad6a834e1ebb6ac845be87a04?pageId=8_a_6de1a647-437b-29ac-9007-7d95e0a8a055","8"

This dictates how    many seats could become up for grabs, when and at what price.        b) Passengers place a bid for seats via the ATA.ONE mobile app. This could be 14 days in    advance. Another 14 days allowed for return flights.        c) When seats become available at a price and time that’s acceptable to the airline and    passenger, the booking is made automatically.        d) E-tickets are sent to the passenger and their journey can start.","—",,"Nov 17, 2015","£175,000","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_total/ata-one","Apps, Commerce and Shopping, Events, Information Technology, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Mobile, Software, Transportation, Travel and Tourism","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/apps-2683","Active","https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ata-one","£505,000","Mar 1, 2018","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_at/ata-one","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/funding_total/ata-one","Private","Series A","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_type/ata-one","11-50","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/people/field/organization.companies/num_employees_enum/ata-one","Air Transportation, E-Commerce Platforms, Information Technology, Mobile, Mobile Apps, Software, Ticketing, Travel","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/categories/air-transportation","Egham, Surrey, United Kingdom","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/location_identifiers/egham-surrey","Unique Air Ticket Distribution Platform","—",,1681292640505,"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 09:44:00 GMT","lYoCdmrD6DcdEvxiMDAr","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organization.companies/14260cdad6a834e1ebb6ac845be87a04?pageId=8_a_6de1a647-437b-29ac-9007-7d95e0a8a055","8"

A platform that allows its users to exchange items with anyone from anywhere in the world. A chance to acquire new items every day!        Their image-focused design and the simple drag-and-drop system makes browsing and exchanging collectibles easier and more fun than ever. Alongside active collectors, who would hugely benefit from being able to find others not previously within their reach, there are many who have been living out this passion only for a short time and still have their stamp collection under their bed, or a set of carefully-ordered napkins in the cupboard. They trust that their website will reawaken their interest, and they’ll stop pondering about what to do with their old collections.","Less than $1M","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/revenue_range/r_00000000","Jan 13, 2015","€290,000","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_total/collectorism","Commerce and Shopping, Consumer Goods, Internet Services","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/commerce-and-shopping","Closed","https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/collectorism","€678,000","Jan 25, 2019","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_at/collectorism","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/funding_total/collectorism","Private","Seed","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_type/collectorism","1-10","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/people/field/organization.companies/num_employees_enum/collectorism","Collectibles, Consumer Goods, Online Portals","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/categories/collectibles","London, England, United Kingdom","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/location_identifiers/london-england","Collectorism is a global network providing a platform for collectors to showcase and exchange their items.","—",,1681292640505,"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 09:44:00 GMT","jadA4LMcxhDT20YBniQl","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organization.companies/14260cdad6a834e1ebb6ac845be87a04?pageId=8_a_6de1a647-437b-29ac-9007-7d95e0a8a055","8"

A world leading end-to-end solution, Spoon Guru combines AI and machine learning with nutritional expertise to enable food retailers to deliver a highly personalised experience tailored to each consumer, based on their distinct and unique dietary, health and wellness needs. The platform processes billions of data points on a  daily basis and analyses every ingredient as well as its nutritional value to allocate the appropriate dietary tags to each product or recipe, enabling large and unstructured data sets to be easily searched and accurately filtered to deliver relevant choices.         64% of the world’s population now actively exclude foodstuffs from their diet (Nielsen). 72% of US consumers say finding healthy food is difficult whilst a staggering 76% of consumers have unintentionally consumed food that’s restricted from their diets.         Spoon Guru enables retailers such as Tesco in the UK, Albert Heijn in the Netherlands, and Woolworths in Australia and New Zealand to cater for shoppers’ distinct and unique dietary needs – increasing the choice of foods available, whilst minimising the effort to find them.         Spoon Guru received a number of accolades including the Retail Week Customer Innovation Award for its partnership with Tesco, the Retail Technology Game Changer Award at the World Retail Awards, and the founders were presented with the Retail & E-Commerce Tech Founder of the Year at the 2018 BMW i UK Tech Founder Awards. In the US, Spoon Guru was chosen as a 2019 Red Herring Top 100 North America winner. The company was also presented the Personalized Nutrition Initiative accolade at the Nutraingredients awards, and awarded a Gold Stevie by the American Business Awards® in the category of Most Innovative Tech Company of the Year.","—",,"Apr 1, 2015","—",,"Commerce and Shopping, Data and Analytics, Food and Beverage, Hardware, Health Care, Software","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/commerce-and-shopping","Active","https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/spoon-guru","—","Sep 30, 2020","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_at/spoon-guru",,"Private","Series A","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_type/spoon-guru","11-50","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/people/field/organization.companies/num_employees_enum/spoon-guru","Big Data, Food and Beverage, Nutrition, Recipes, Retail Technology","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/categories/big-data","London, England, United Kingdom","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/location_identifiers/london-england","A leading retail solution provider, we deliver seamless product discovery based on shopper dietary & lifestyle needs.","—",,1681292640506,"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 09:44:00 GMT","9gNz2YnAjGNIsjmmpTCL","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organization.companies/14260cdad6a834e1ebb6ac845be87a04?pageId=10_a_f1a37af4-5ee8-4f2b-f79b-3c566487eaff","10"

Sensitive data loss and leaks are problems faced by more than 78% of SMBs according to a 2014 survey. Among them, 72% shut down less than 1 year after the incident. Just one of these incidents led to $6.2M losses. The solutions currently are either insufficient of too expensive for these companies.        Ukkobox (Company no. 09527513 - UK). has an easy tool that safely encrypts and spreads user files to existing cloud providers worldwide. Because they store only parts of the files on each provider with redundancy, they are secured and accessible even if some of these providers suffer an outage or are hacked.         Their unique dispersal process developed by Univ. of São Paulo (Brazil) and Univ. of Leicester (UK) represents an entry technological barrier that can be patented. If the user requires additional privacy levels, they can choose providers from states with weak international relations among themselves and distinct data privacy laws/regulations. This provides an additional geopolitical security mechanism resilient to encryption vulnerabilities, which makes unauthorized access even from governments almost impossible. They will have to cooperate with ""enemies"" countries to retrieve all data slices and also break data encryption to access user files.This technology able to scale globally along with a multi-skilled team, composed with founders with high technical security and cloud background, business knowledge, international law and creative marketing and design are the most interesting Ukkobox assets.         For the user it is straightforward. He just download and install their  app, choose the providers and countries he wishes to use for his spreading storage box, receives a temporary authentication token in his mobile and put the files inside Ukkobox folder. Their app will then encrypt, split and spread the files from the user device to storage providers directly. This ensures that they will have zero knowledge of the user stored data and access patterns. Thus ensuring full privacy for their customer's stored data.        They will monetize their  solution using a SaaS model.

It is designed for tracking mobile apps (iOS/Android) statistics.        BASIC IDEA    Let’s assume that you are an app owner, for example a game developer. You might want to know in detail what your users do within your game: how many users manage to get through the first or second level; how many gamers use in-app payments and when they use it (particular game level/ time of the day/week).        Moreover, app owner may require installation data: total installations number, the source of installation, whether it was commercial traffic or organic one (AppStore or Google play). Also, you would probably like to know the most effective traffic source (advertising networks, CPI/CPA services) in terms of the maximum download number, the most loyal customers attracted and the highest income, based on the comparison of the traffic source, installation, and in-app purchases.        Surely you acquire your traffic via CPI/CPA model and would like to have a sustainable integration in media sources that will send postbacks to CPI/CPA right after the first app’s initialization.        InstallTracker can do all of the above and even more.        We offer a reliable product at a fair price and with a simple integration of our SDK into your mobile applications.","$1M to $10M","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/revenue_range/r_00001000","Jan 30, 2015","$1,000,000","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_total/installtracker","Advertising, Data and Analytics, Mobile","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/advertising-f0bd","Closed","https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/installtracker","$1,000,000","Mar 26, 2015","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_at/installtracker","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/funding_total/installtracker","Private","Seed","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_type/installtracker","11-50","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/people/field/organization.companies/num_employees_enum/installtracker","Ad Network, Analytics, Mobile","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/categories/ad-network","London, England, United Kingdom","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/location_identifiers/london-england","Easy and Reliable Mobile Analytics","—",,1681292640506,"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 09:44:00 GMT","9US0yxNwVDN773HywCT3","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organization.companies/14260cdad6a834e1ebb6ac845be87a04?pageId=11_a_119e34f8-0377-7c65-c0c0-b3b7c747b4cc","11"

The unique CricViz computer model enables the prediction of match outcome, the interpretation of team and player performance and the anticipation of what is likely to happen next; cricket intelligence at the next level.        WinViz probabilities are generated by CricViz’s unique computer model of Test cricket. This utilises a database of the last 500 Test matches played, using past and current data to estimate the probability of future events.        The model uses the current state of the match, each player’s career history and characteristics of the venue and host country to simulate the remainder of the match. The simulations are run thousands of times, with the number of results that produce each match outcome converted into probabilities – if 4,000 out of 10,000 iterations result in a team winning, then that team has a 40% probability of winning.        The PredictViz function outlines the most likely course the match will follow from its current position. The unique CricViz model of past and current data simulates the remainder of the game thousands of times, with the average predicted outcome for each team plotted across the game’s remaining timeline.        The likeliest score and end point of each innings is predicted using the current state of the match, each player’s career history and characteristics of the venue and host country.        PlayViz breaks down each team’s performance into its three basic aspects – batting, bowling and fielding. Each of those areas is given a positive or negative score in runs, measuring the performance of that team against that of an average Test team in the conditions present at that time.        Team performances are compared to those of an average Test team, with adjustments taken into account for the pitch and opposition strength. The comprehensive historical database predicts the average performance of batsmen and bowlers in the position and role they are playing in. The PlayViz function measures performance relative to averages that take into account extra variables.        Each team’s fielding performance is measured on the direct impact it has had on the score. Runs saved and missed are totalled for each player, with a dropped catch measured at the value of the wicket that was missed according to the model of projected scores. Fielding scores are adjusted by a system that rates the difficulty of a piece of fielding.        BatViz gives a measure of how difficult batting has been in the last 30 minutes of play. It shows how hard it is for the batsmen to survive and score.        The ball tracking data from every ball bowled in the match is compared to a database of over 300,000 Test deliveries. The balls in this database that are the most similar to the delivery being measured are evaluated in terms of wickets taken and runs conceded, with a game aggregate built to provide a metric of current batting difficulty at that time.","$1M to $10M","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/revenue_range/r_00001000","2015","—",,"Artificial Intelligence, Data and Analytics, Software, Sports","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/artificial-intelligence-e551","Active","https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cricviz","—","Oct 20, 2015","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_at/cricviz",,"Private","Seed","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_type/cricviz","1-10","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/people/field/organization.companies/num_employees_enum/cricviz","Predictive Analytics, Sports","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/categories/predictive-analytics-ca83","London, England, United Kingdom","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/location_identifiers/london-england","Cricviz helps to understand cricket in greater detail than ever before with depth analysis.","—",,1681292640506,"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 09:44:00 GMT","FVFH3jBtw89dkHhKuPwA","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organization.companies/14260cdad6a834e1ebb6ac845be87a04?pageId=13_a_1277bd33-77a2-091f-1924-233cecc9f90c","13"

Majority of these shoppers leave due to price considerations; so you can imagine the amount of money being left on the table! We help any online retailer that wants to increase customer retention & turn their inventory faster without giving one-size-fits all discounts.        We do this by allowing online, automated price negotiation. FOSHO is a machine learning based API that retailers can embed on their site / chatbot and allow shoppers to negotiate. We all know what negotiation means, we have  certainly negotiated when we wanted a better salary or a cheaper car but, we have never experienced the ability to negotiate when we have shopped online!        That’s the innovation of FOSHO. Users can negotiate on any product / service by making offers and our smart interface responds with instant, personalised counteroffers! A shopper can negotiate by making multiple offers within 2 minutes till FOSHO agrees on the price. Now shoppers don’t need to waste time on promo codes, cash back options or even waiting for sales seasons. And the online retailer is better off with more sales and happier customers. FOSHO is unique as it even gives you discounts to you in lieu of newsletter subscription, product reviews, waiving return rights, helping maintain retailer’s ROI and other customisable options – which has never been done before!              Fosho does this though its unique negotiation algorithm, which takes pre-defined rules from vendors and then optimises for various parameters real time. The shopper can thus 'negotiate' for price at point-of-sale.         This technology allows vendors to increase their profits without giving the same, flat discount to all.  Its a more efficient way of economic optimisation!","—",,"Feb 26, 2015","$16,000","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_total/fosho","Artificial Intelligence, Commerce and Shopping, Data and Analytics, Software","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/artificial-intelligence-e551","Closed","https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/fosho","$16,000","Nov 1, 2015","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_at/fosho","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/funding_total/fosho","Private","Seed","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_type/fosho","1-10","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/people/field/organization.companies/num_employees_enum/fosho","E-Commerce, Enterprise Software, Machine Learning, Retail","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/categories/e-commerce-275d","London, England, United Kingdom","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/location_identifiers/london-england","A machine learning based price personalisation product for online retailers","—",,1681292640506,"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 09:44:00 GMT","wSxiNjG6HDNrAplx8WO9","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organization.companies/14260cdad6a834e1ebb6ac845be87a04?pageId=13_a_1277bd33-77a2-091f-1924-233cecc9f90c","13"

These measurements are used to parametrically adjust the pattern of the bra she selects - using a series of algorithms to create a pattern that is 100% the perfect fit for the woman.     The bras are then custom made currently manually but shortly with robotic technology, currently they are first to market with this technology.     More than 85% of women are currently wearing the incorrect sized bra leading to scientifically and medically proven medical and postural problems - some serious.     The major cause of this is incorrect measurements as Traditional Bras are based on only three measurements. A second cause is inconsistent sizing due to style differences. A third issue is attempting to fit a non-standard bust in a standard (within brands) sizing system.        In terms of competitors at this stage there is no one in the marketplace doing what they do in terms of the mobile scanning and parametric adjustment of patterns - soon, every smart phone will have this technology in them... So now is the time to build the business taking advantage of this hardware becoming ubiquitous, in perpetration for the market shift.    The closest competitor they would have is True&Co a highly successful start-up online lingerie company based in San Francisco - but they base their sizing on the traditional 3 sizes and suggest the correct size to potential consumers via an online quiz.","—",,"2015","—",,"Apps, Clothing and Apparel, Consumer Goods, Design, Hardware, Mobile, Science and Engineering, Software","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/apps-2683","Active","https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/the-digital-bra","—","Jan 1, 2015","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_at/the-digital-bra",,"Private","Seed","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organization.companies/last_funding_type/the-digital-bra","1-10","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/people/field/organization.companies/num_employees_enum/the-digital-bra","Apps, CAD, Developer Tools, Fashion, Lingerie, Mobile, Robotics","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/categories/apps","London, England, United Kingdom","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/location_identifiers/london-england","The Digital Bra is a mobile applications that uses 3D scans to create a customized bra for each user.","—",,1681292640506,"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 09:44:00 GMT","AY44eFeNc35TqfzeHit7","https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organization.companies/14260cdad6a834e1ebb6ac845be87a04?pageId=14_a_ae5deb81-12cd-27fa-6f82-b69abf7984f5","14"

Coding is the new literacy. It is on the school curriculum in the UK from age 5 because it is important that every child is digitally literate in order to thrive and succeed in an increasingly digital world.        Our unique teaching method introduces children from all backgrounds to coding through song, rhyme and storytelling - and with the launch of their semi-independent learn-to-code app for 3-6yr olds (Looparoo), we embed a curiosity and love for STEM before biases set in.        We also realise that a lot of the adults who support children with their learning, be they parents, teachers or carers, have never coded in their lives.

The aim of this evidence based community programme is to promote a healthy lifestyle both in pre-school children, aged between one and five, and their carers. The 24-week intervention is delivered as one two hour session per week over a 24 week period. The programme includes nutrition education, physical activity and behaviour change components with an emphasis on family involvement and learning through art and play.
