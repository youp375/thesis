To date, we’ve helped people from all walks of life become their own bosses, with not just a car, but the tools to earn even more money, and become better drivers.

It was a problem, but it could be fixed. Now, four years later, Splend is able to offer freedom to all kinds of people through car rental, and rent-to-own options. But we don’t stop there. We provide unprecedented levels of support and training, to help our members make the most of their time on the road. And, by providing members with data and analytics, we give them the opportunity to become more profitable and safer drivers. All that, plus the chance to connect with other drivers and be part of a growing community, making driving a more sustainable way of earning an income.

SSI is a new paradigm for exchanging trusted digital data related to people, companies, and things in a much more secure and privacy-preserving fashion that puts people in control of their data. Far too often, digital identity services online are slow, user-hostile, and expensive for businesses to process. It costs anywhere from $10 onwards to verify the identity of people online, and upwards of $100s for corporate entities. Over the past few years many startups, established ID companies, governments, and non-profits have used decentralised identity to give people more control back of their data and make its use secure and transparent. BUT... What is currently missing is an incentives layer for the self-sovereign identity ecosystem, which hampers adoption. We use blockchain to create a decentralised network for digital identity payments. Once we build this, we will build tools to allow digital ID payments agnostic of ledger. Our initial target segment is B2B, to any companies building products on decentralised ID for people and companies. We will work with these ID companies to integrate verim's digital ID payment rails and network. Our future roadmap includes plans for enterprise and SaaS software that allows large/mid- cap organisations that want to monetise their digital ID issuance. Our mission is to make digital identity more accessible, inclusive, and commercially sustainable. Our core product is a blockchain network that makes exchanging and paying for trusted data easy, inclusive, and secure. We built this core on blockchain technology, as we believe no single company should be in control of such critical Web infrastructure. Our vision is that this new form of digital identity applies beyond just the financial industry and will be transformative for almost every industry sector imaginable. Through our network, anyone can verify identities quickly and securely with the ability for organisations checking the data to be compensated for their work.",,2021-03-01,month,2600000,USD,2600000,"Financial Services, Information Technology, Other, Privacy and Security",Active,2021-09-22,,,,,

The system raises early warning on network assets for possible undesirable activity, by applying a Bayesian-based framework to systematically analyze indicators associated with early stages of such activity. This approach dramatically reduces the processing overheads of monitoring. The benefits to the security operation include scalability to networks exceeding 1 billion devices, providing earlier visibility of risk and improving prioritization and decision-making in deploying countermeasures.

We build member-owned and governed decentralised network platforms for the peer-to-peer exchange of tokenised value between network members. Our ethos and architecture is grounded in protocol, peer-to-peer architecture, removing friction and market inefficiencies, strong security guarantees and interoperable exchange across platforms to build a peer-to-peer ecosystem for market infrastructure. Our focus is capital markets; we work with firms that have the ambition to reinvent the industry's business models. Our technology is p2p network platforms and protocol first - protocol suite, software that implements those protocols and provides client software and infrastructure for p2p networks. Its based on Ethereum and we call it Autonity - the protocol, the Geth-based client. We use our technology to build p2p networks and dFMI. P2p networks are private, member-owned and governed networks that enable peer-to-peer transfer of financial value and automation of contractual and fiduciary operations without reliance on trusted third-parties. Such decentralised networks can interact with one another, creating a wider ecosystem of value and leveraging the network effect, and they can form part of a dFMI. dFMI is a new concept, one that builds on the security and resilience guarantees of distributed ledger and systems engineering to provide a platform for tokenising value and transferring its ownership between participants on that or, by cross-platform exchange, on other platforms. We believe that our technology will drive adoption of a next-generation dFMI where intermediaries are removed, incentive structures encourage self-regulation, and risks are mitigated and reduced to the maximum. dFMI doesn't just provide a cryptographically secure environment for market participants to transact, it provides a peer-to-peer model that removes financial intermediaries and engenders a wider ecosystem for value transfer across platforms and pre- post-trade processes. dFMI works to mitigate concentration and liquidity risk, reduce settlement cycles to real-time, remove friction, and lower the transaction cost of economic exchange. Clearmatics is a company with a strong belief in the open source movement and good ties to the Ethereum community.

The CaRi-Heart® System is a cloud-based medical device supporting the CaRi-Heart® Analysis Service. The CaRi-Heart® System is CE Mark certified under the latest EU MDR.  Exceptional validation results showing Cari-Heart’s ability to predict heart attack have been published on leading medical journals including the Lancet, JACC and JAMA. CaRi-Heart validation and implementation projects have been supported by multiple UK government grants and awards, including the NHS AI Stage 3 Award for real-world evaluation of CaRi-Heart care pathway, and funding from NHS England to pilot the CaRi-Heart care pathway in multiple NHS hospitals.
